abstract = {Monitoring biodiversity and how anthropogenic pressures impact this is critical, especially as anthropogenically driven climate change continues to affect all ecosystems. Intertidal areas are exposed to particularly high levels of pressures owing to increased population density in coastal areas. Traditional methods of monitoring intertidal areas do not provide datasets with full coverage in a cost-effective or timely manner, and so the use of remote sensing to monitor these areas is becoming more common. Monitoring of ecologically important monospecific habitats, such as seagrass beds, using remote sensing techniques is well documented. However, the ability for multispectral data to distinguish efficiently and accurately between classes of vegetation with similar pigment composition, such as seagrass and green algae, has proved difficult, often requiring hyperspectral data. A machine learning approach was used to differentiate between soft-bottom intertidal vegetation classes when exposed at low tide, comparing 6 different multi- and hyperspectral remote and in situ sensors. For the library of 366 spectra, collected across Northern Europe, high accuracy (>80%) was found across all spectral resolutions. While a higher spectral resolution resulted in higher accuracy, there was no discernible increase in accuracy above 10 spectral bands (95%: Sentinel-2 MSI sensor with a spatial resolution of 20 m). This work highlights the ability of multispectral sensors to discriminate intertidal vegetation types, while also showing the most important wavelengths for this discrimination (∼530 and ∼ 730 nm), giving recommendations for spectral ranges of future satellite missions. The ability for multispectral sensors to aid in accurate and rapid intertidal vegetation classification at the taxonomic resolution of classes, could be a significant contribution for future sustainable and effective ecosystem management.}

ABSTRACT = {The recent development and miniaturization of hyperspectral sensors embedded in drones has allowed the acquisition of hyperspectral images with high spectral and spatial resolution. The characteristics of both the embedded sensors and drones (viewing angle, flying altitude, resolution) create opportunities to consider the use of hyperspectral imagery to map and monitor macroalgae communities. In general, the overflight of the areas to be mapped is conconmittently associated accompanied with measurements carried out in the field to acquire the spectra of previously identified objects. An alternative to these simultaneous acquisitions is to use a hyperspectral library made up of pure spectra of the different species in place, that would spare field acquisition of spectra during each flight. However, the use of such a technique requires developed appropriate procedure for testing the level of species classification that can be achieved, as well as the reproducibility of the classification over time. This study presents a novel classification approach based on the use of reflectance spectra of macroalgae acquired in controlled conditions. This overall approach developed is based on both the use of the spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithm applied on first derivative hyperspectral data. The efficiency of this approach has been tested on a hyperspectral library composed of 16 macroalgae species, and its temporal reproducibility has been tested on a monthly survey of the spectral response of different macro-algae species. In addition, the classification results obtained with this new approach were also compared to the results obtained through the use of the most recent and robust procedure published. The classification obtained shows that the developed approach allows to perfectly discriminate the different phyla, whatever the period. At the species level, the classification approach is less effective when the individuals studied belong to phylogenetically close species (i.e., Fucus spiralis and Fucus serratus).},

   abstract = {A new fast mapping approach based on an optical model was developed and applied to hyperspectral airborne HySpex images of Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast). The aims were (1) to discriminate diatom biofilms (from the Bacillariophyceae class) constituting microphytobenthos on any mudflat and (2) to estimate their biomass expressed in mgChla.m -2 by remote sensing of poorly accessible mudflats.Due to the distinct absorption peaks of certain pigments of different microalgae classes constituting microphytobenthos, the high spectral resolution of hyperspectral images was employed in order to detect the pigment assemblage characterizing diatom biofilms. Thus, the HySpex 1600 VNIR camera was used both in the laboratory for estimating biomass under controlled conditions and in an airborne setting. 1) The mapping approach used known spectral indices (NDVI and MPBI) and new ones (I Diatom and I Euglenid ) to characterize quickly the key pigments of two main microphytobenthos classes, for a fast selection of diatom and euglenid biofilms by two different masks. 2) The inherent spectral properties of biofilms in the 700-900nm range were also used to calculate an original estimate of the substrate/environmental effects in each mask. 3) Biomass quantification of the diatom biofilms was finally performed by application of the microphytobenthos optical model (MPBOM).This approach was first tested on laboratory HySpex images of synthetic biofilms for which the in vitro biomass measurements by chromatography (HPLC) were available. The comparison between estimated and measured biomass values showed the reliability of the mapping approach for biomass estimation. Finally, a map of diatom biomass was obtained at the scale of the entire Bourgneuf Bay. The range of biomass variation (0-35mgChla.m -2 ) was in close agreement with the biomass maps presented in previous studies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The aim of this work is to assess the use of (SPOT) multispectral visible infrared remote sensing to study microphytobentos assemblages in a shellfish ecosystem (Bay of Bourgneuf, France). SPOT satellite images (acquired at low tide in spring or autumn between 1986 and 1998) were calibrated using in situ radiometric data, and the normalised vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from these images showed microphytobenthos on bay mudflats. Proliferation was mainly along a north-south strip, essentially localised around the +2 m isobath and covering a surface area of 19 to 25% of the total mudflat area studied (420 to 550 ha). Three factors seem to be responsible for the spatial structure of the assemblages: bathymetry, nutrient input from the Falleron River and its channel, and the location of oyster-farming areas. Although spatial and spectral resolutions of multispectral remote sensing data have certain limitations, this approach opens up a new field of application for hyperspectral remote sensing, particularly for synoptic mapping of biomass distribution. © 2003 Académie des sciences.

Four sediment properties were considered: organic matter content, moisture content, chlorophyll a content, and mud content. The utilized data were a hyperspectral image and its accompanying field data. The methodology included spectral and spatial resampling of this image to the properties of the spaceborne multispectral sensors. Then, these resampled data were analyzed by means of unsupervised classification. The results showed that spaceborne multispectral data have the potential for sediment characterization. Yet, compared to the hyperspectral image, the characterization of the different properties generally decreased. The results showed the spectral suitability of Landsat sensors to characterize all properties and the spectral and spatial suitability of all sensors to characterize chlorophyll a content. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Estuaries and coasts are among the most productive ecosystems and constitute valuable habitats for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Amongst nearshore ecosystems, seagrass beds play a major role enhancing biodiversity and water quality. Consequently, the development of new approaches to create extensive and high-resolution habitat maps is required not only to implement conservation, restoration and management plans, but also to establish adaptation plans to face climate change impacts. This study particularly assesses the capability of hyperspectral airborne imagery acquired with Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, with special focus on Zostera noltii seagrass meadows. To this end, 13 habitats were defined along the supralittoral, intertidal and subtidal zones of an estuary, including Z.noltii seagrass meadows. The CASI sensor was configured to acquire 25 bands in the visible and near infrared wavelengths with a ground sampling distance of 2 m. Spectral bands were selected for species discrimination based on the spectral signature of the different habitat classes. Six different band combinations were tested applying maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The most accurate classification was obtained with 10 band combination (a mean producer accuracy 92% and a mean user accuracy 94%). The classification of Z.noltii beds has been found to be restricted to moderate and high dense meadows, however a vegetation index has been defined which could be applied for mapping Z. noltii meadow cover.

   abstract = {The normalized difference water index (NDWI) of McFeeters (1996) was modified by substitution of a middle infrared band such as Landsat TM band 5 for the near infrared band used in the NDWI. The modified NDWI (MNDWI) can enhance open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built-up land noise as well as vegetation and soil noise. The enhanced water information using the NDWI is often mixed with built-up land noise and the area of extracted water is thus overestimated. Accordingly, the MNDWI is more suitable for enhancing and extracting water information for a water region with a background dominated by built-up land areas because of its advantage in reducing and even removing built-up land noise over the NDWI.},

   abstract = {In previous classification studies, three non-parametric classifiers, Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were reported as the foremost classifiers at producing high accuracies. However, only a few studies have compared the performances of these classifiers with different training sample sizes for the same remote sensing images, particularly the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI). In this study, we examined and compared the performances of the RF, kNN, and SVM classifiers for land use/cover classification using Sentinel-2 image data. An area of 30 × 30 km2 within the Red River Delta of Vietnam with six land use/cover types was classified using 14 different training sample sizes, including balanced and imbalanced, from 50 to over 1250 pixels/class. All classification results showed a high overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 90% to 95%. Among the three classifiers and 14 sub-datasets, SVM produced the highest OA with the least sensitivity to the training sample sizes, followed consecutively by RF and kNN. In relation to the sample size, all three classifiers showed a similar and high OA (over 93.85%) when the training sample size was large enough, i.e., greater than 750 pixels/class or representing an area of approximately 0.25% of the total study area. The high accuracy was achieved with both imbalanced and balanced datasets.},

   abstract = {Sentinel-2 is intended to improve vegetation assessment at local to global scales. Today, estimation of leaf nitrogen (N) as an indicator of rangeland quality is possible using hyperspectral systems. However, few studies based on commercial imageries have shown a potential of the red-edge band to accurately predict leaf N at the broad landscape scale. We intend to investigate the utility of Sentinel-2 for estimating leaf N concentration in the African savanna. Grass canopy reflectance was measured using the analytical spectral device (ASD) in concert with leaf sample collections for leaf N chemical analysis. ASD reflectance data were resampled to the spectral bands of Sentinel-2 using published spectral response functions. Random forest (RF), partial least square regression (PLSR), and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) were used to predict leaf N using all 13 bands. Using leave-one-out cross validation , the RF model explained 90% of leaf N variation, with a root mean square error of 0.04 (6% of the mean), which is higher than that of PLSR and SMLR. Using RF, spectral bands centered at 705 nm (red edge) and two shortwave infrared bands centered at 2190 and 1610 nm were found to be the most important bands in predicting leaf N.},

The biodiversity is often predicted using spatially continuous data of seabed biophysical properties. Seabed hardness is an important property for predicting the biodiversity and is often inferred from multibeam backscatter data. Seabed hardness can also be inferred based on underwater video footage that is, however, only available at a limited number of sampled locations. In this study, we predict the spatial distribution of seabed hardness using random forest (RF) based on video classification and seabed properties. We illustrate the effects of cross-validation methods including a new cross-validation function (rf.cv) on selecting the most optimal predictive model.

   abstract = {L'orientation générale La procédure d'élaboration et d'adoption de la directive a mis en évidence les stratégies respectives des Etats membres, via le Conseil, et du Parlement. In fine, le résultat de la conciliation fait apparaître les priorités de chacun : le Conseil s'est prioritairement attaché à maîtriser les contraintes devant être imposées aux Etats membres et les coûts induits. Son attachement à maintenir le caractère non obligatoire de la récupération des coûts par exemple, manifeste cette attention à un enjeu dépassant fortement la politique de l'eau et rejaillissant sur les équilibres économiques et sociaux nationaux ; le Parlement s'est plutôt concentré sur les aspects écologiques et sur le caractère obligatoire des objectifs fixés dans ce domaine. Il est par exemple demeuré inflexible sur les dispositions concernant les substances dangereuses, et sur l'inscription dans le texte de la directive du caractère essentiel de la dimension environnementale. Finalement, si la directive-cadre innove par une approche transversale de l'eau et par l'intégration d'une importante dimension économique, la dimension écologique, plus " classique ", apparaît donc très clairement. Cette double dimension se retrouve ainsi dès le premier considérant qui énonce que " L'eau n'est pas un bien marchand comme les autres mais un patrimoine qu'il faut protéger, défendre et traiter comme tel. " Plusieurs autres considérants témoignent également de la prégnance de la dimension écologique. Ainsi, le deuxième considérant rappelle le point de référence initial du texte, qui est le séminaire ministériel de Francfort (1988) soulignant la nécessité d'une législation communautaire sur la qualité écologique. La Commission avait d'ailleurs présenté en 1992 une première proposition sur ce thème, qui a ensuite été écartée en raison d'une approche trop fortement écologique ne correspondant plus aux attentes des acteurs. De même, le considérant 27 précise que " l'objectif ultime consiste à assurer l'élimination de substances dangereuses prioritaires et à contribuer à obtenir, dans l'environnement marin, des concentrations qui soient proches des niveaux de fond pour les substances présentes naturellement ". Cette place accordée aux enjeux écologiques tient aussi au postulat partagé par la Commission, le Parlement et le Conseil : la protection de l'environnement est l'objectif principal en ce qu'il permet de répondre aux autres objectifs que sont l'approvisionnement en eau potable des populations et la satisfaction d'autres usages marchands. Pour ce faire, l'objectif à atteindre dans les districts est un bon état écologique des eaux à l'horizon 2015. Les plans de gestion, sur la base de l'état des lieux établi dans chaque district (12/2004), doivent mobiliser les moyens techniques, économiques et juridiques permettant d'atteindre cet objectif, ou de s'en rapprocher le plus possible. Que trouve-t-on dans la directive ? Quelques chiffres donnent un aperçu des particularités de la directive-cadre, et traduisent les préoccupations qui ont prévalu au cours de l'élaboration : 53 considérants, permettant de rappeler la genèse de la directive et de poser un certain nombre de principes, préoccupation naturellement importante dans le cas d'une directive-cadre ; 26 articles seulement, dont 3 indiquent les échéances, la date d'entrée en vigueur et les destinataires du texte ; 11 annexes, dont une (annexe 10 sur les substances prioritaires) a été intégrée par une décision du Parlement et du Conseil de novembre 2001 ; 72 pages du JOCE, dont 50 d'annexes et 30 pour la seule annexe 5 autour de laquelle de vifs débats ont eu lieu, puisqu'elle définit les différents états des eaux, énonce les méthodes de suivi, etc. Bien que la directive ne procède à aucune classification des dispositions (chapitres, sections), 6 parties principales peuvent être distinguées. La définition des objectifs généraux et du cadre de mise en œuvre (art. 1à 4) Ces articles posent le cadre général d'application de la directive : objectif fondamental : établir un cadre pour la protection des eaux entrant dans le champ d'application ; objectifs environnementaux : bon état écologique des eaux à atteindre en 15 ans et assouplissements envisageables ; champ d'application : eaux intérieures de surface, eaux de transition, eaux côtières et eaux souterraines ; définitions : le sens de 41 termes, expressions et concepts utilisés dans la directive est précisé ; échelle spatiale : innovation importante, le cadre spatial retenu pour la mise en œuvre de la directive est le district hydrographique ; coordination de la mise en œuvre : une autorité compétente doit être désignée dans chaque district ; L'identification des objectifs propres à chaque bassin (art. 5 à 7) Une analyse d'ensemble du district doit être engagée sous la forme d'un état des lieux balayant trois aspects : caractéristiques du district ; incidences des activités humaines ; analyse économique de l'utilisation de l'eau. Cette analyse doit être achevée fin 2004 pour l'ensemble des districts ; il s'agit de la première échéance opérationnelle de la mise en œuvre de la directive. Elle est complétée par l'établissement d'un registre des zones protégées, qui font l'objet d'un traitement spécifique et une série de dispositions propres aux eaux utilisées pour le captage d'eau potable. L'énumération des instruments utilisables pour atteindre les objectifs (art. 8 à 10) La directive identifie 3 instruments principaux pour atteindre les objectifs dans chaque bassin, sur la base des constats dressés au terme de l'état des lieux : l'instrument technique : les programmes de surveillance. L'état des eaux doit être mesuré et suivi dans les districts, selon des méthodologies détaillées fournies à l'annexe 5 ; l'instrument économique : la récupération des coûts et la tarification. Après de vifs débats sur le degré de contrainte, il a été décidé que " les Etats membres tiennent compte du principe de la récupération des coûts des services liés à l'utilisation de l'eau ". Par ailleurs, la tarification doit être utilisée pour inciter les usagers à une utilisation rationnelle de la ressource. Le recours à ces instruments économiques tient compte des facteurs sociaux, environnementaux, climatiques, etc. ; l'instrument réglementaire : l'approche combinée. Il s'agit de mettre en place des contrôles d'émission (par exemple sous la forme d'autorisations préalables) puis de définir des valeurs limites d'émission. S'il apparaît que cela ne permet pas d'atteindre une qualité suffisante des milieux, des contrôles plus stricts sont fixés en conséquence. Les méthodes de réalisation des objectifs (art. 11 à 15) Sur la base de l'état des lieux, et compte tenu des objectifs à atteindre, un programme de mesures (au sens de programme d'action) est défini pour chaque district. Il s'agit a minima de mesures de base, essentiellement réglementaires (application de l'ensemble des dispositions en vigueur, autorisations préalables, etc.), et si cela ne suffit pas pour atteindre les objectifs, de mesures complémentaires telles qu'accords volontaires, codes de bonnes pratiques, etc. (cf. annexe 6). L'ensemble de ces mesures est structuré au sein d'un plan de gestion du district, document de planification formalisant l'articulation entre état des lieux, objectifs et programme de mesures. Compte tenu des engagements forts pris dans le plan de gestion, l'accent est mis sur l'implication du public dans la procédure d'élaboration : il ne s'agit pas simplement de l'informer de l'avancement des travaux et de lui donner accès aux documents : sa participation doit également être organisée. et sur le " rapportage " à la Commission sur la mise en œuvre de l'ensemble. Les stratégies (art. 16 et 17) En complément de l'ensemble du dispositif, le Parlement a souhaité intégrer deux dispositifs spécifiques, concernant : une stratégie de lutte contre la pollution de l'eau : ce thème a été l'objet d'intenses négociations. Selon le risque présenté par diverses substances, des mesures spécifiques doivent être envisagées, allant jusqu'à la suppression des rejets pour les substances dangereuses prioritaires ; une stratégie visant à prévenir et à contrôler la pollution des eaux souterraines : cette disposition indique l'attention accordée aux eaux souterraines et la volonté du Parlement d'assurer leur prise en compte expresse et leur protection. Les Etats membres sont enjoints de prendre des dispositions spécifiques si la Commission ne l'a pas fait. Les dispositions finales (art. 18 à 26) Diverses dispositions sont réunies en fin de directive, concernant l'entrée en vigueur, les rapports sur la mise en œuvre produits par la Commission, etc. Il faut principalement noter : l'article 20, qui prévoit la possibilité pour la Commission d'adopter des lignes directrices pour l'application des annexes 2 et 5 (désignation des masses d'eau, définition de l'état des milieux, procédures de suivi, etc.) ; l'article 22 qui énumère les directives qui seront abrogées sous 7 ou 13 ans : parmi elles figurent notamment la directive " eaux potabilisables " de 1975 (7 ans), ou encore les directives " eaux piscicoles ", " eaux conchylicoles " ou encore " substances dangereuses " (13 ans). Quelques interrogations Si la directive est marquée par diverses avancées (participation du public, planification de la gestion de l'eau, prise en compte de la dimension économique, etc.), il demeure naturellement un certain nombre de questions : compte tenu des vifs débats qui ont marqué tout le processus d'élaboration de la directive, le texte final, fruit d'un consensus difficile, ne peut satisfaire toutes les parties concernées. Une interrogation fondamentale concerne l'approche uniforme retenue par la directive : les mêmes obligations s'appliquent dans toute l'Union, sur tous les districts et les mêmes procédures devront être mises en œuvre. Compte tenu de la diversité de milieux existant},

   abstract = {For the inhabitants of many of the world's major towns and cities, estuaries provide their first and nearest glimpse of a natural habitat. Despite the attempts of man to pollute or reclaim it, the estuarine ecosystem continues to provide a fascinating insight into a natural world where energy is transformed from sunlight into plant material, and then through the steps of a food chain is converted into a rich food supply for birds and fish. When the previous editions of this book appeared, biologists were beginning to realize that the estuarine ecosystem was an ideal habitat in which to observe the processes controlling biological productivity. In the intervening period, many more estuaries and their inhabitants have been studied intensively. It is now possible to answer many of the questions posed by the earlier editions, and to pursue further the explanation of high productivity in estuaries and of energy utilization at different trophic levels within estuarine food webs. A significant amount of new information has also been accumulated on the human use and abuse of these habitats, particularly the effects of pollution. Although the world's seas are vast and may appear capable of receiving unlimited quantities of human effluent, such waste is often first discharged into the confined waters of estuaries. In practice, marine pollution is often essentially estuarine pollution. To reflect the huge impact of humans on estuaries, and to consider how we may either modify, remove or enrich the estuarine ecosystem, three completely new chapters have been prepared in this edition. These consider anthropogenic change (including pollution) in estuaries, the diverse uses and abuses of the estuarine habitat by man, and the methods used to study human induced changes in estuaries. Finally, this text examines the ways in which estuarine management can monitor, control or prevent the pollution and destruction of this fragile ecosystem.},

   abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive will have instituted the concept of Ecological Quality Status (EQS) as a way to assess the biological quality of water masses. The EQS will be based mainly upon the composition of the different biological compartments in the ecosystem specially the benthos as compared to certain reference sites. Such management tools are already well established for freshwater (i.e. biotic indices), but not for coastal and estuarine (i.e. transitional) waters. In the framework of the Seine-Aval programme a workshop on benthic indicators was organized at Wimereux (France) in June 2005. The aim of this workshop and this paper is (1) to present the experiences of the Seine Aval researchers, and the French scientific approaches to benthic indicators, with those international experiences and approaches that have been published or are under development; and (2) to examine the existing benthic tools and their possible use in the characterization of the state of estuarine ecosystems. The debate during the workshop and the numerous recently published on the WFD are discussed in term of the implementation of the WFD in transitional water bodies using benthic indicators and indices. Some proposals for the future underline the needs to re-examine and adapt the different index thresholds, to take into account physical disturbances, to inventory the existing conditions vs reference conditions and to be as pragmatic as possible in using the WFD in transitional waters. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = { Microphytobenthos are significant primary producers in many coastal systems. It is therefore important to quantify their biomass and productivity. Chlorophyll- a is often used as an index for microphytobenthic biomass. However, complications arise as most studies of sediment properties have been on a millimetre scale, whilst chemical and biological gradients in the surface layers of sediment occur over a microscale. The development of a new technique, the Cryolander (Wiltshire et al., 1997; Wiltshire, 2000), now allows microscale analysis of the sediment surface. Areas of high and low diatom biomass were compared using two coring techniques of different vertical resolution; the Cryolander method, with a vertical resolution of 0·2 mm and plastic core tubes (coarse coring), with a vertical resolution of 5 mm. Results indicated that, except at extreme biomass levels, coarse coring does not detect statistically significant differences in chlorophyll- a between obviously diverse sample sites. This may lead to misinterpretation of seasonal and spatial data when coarse coring is used. Furthermore microscale sectioning allows distinctions to be made between chlorophyll- a measured in the photic zone (photosynthetically active biomass (PAB)) and chlorophyll- a measured below the photic zone (photosynthetically inactive biomass (PIB)), allowing accurate determination of biomass specific primary production. },

   abstract = {Microphytobenthos plays a vital role in estuarine and coastal carbon cycling and food webs. Yet, the role of exogenous factors, and thus the effects of climate change, in regulating microphytobenthic biomass is poorly understood. We aimed to unravel the mechanisms structuring microphytobenthic biomass both within and across ecosystems. The spatiotemporal distribution of the biomass of intertidal benthic algae (dominated by diatoms) was estimated with an unprecedented spatial ex- tent from time-series of Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from a 6-year period of daily Aqua MODIS 250-m images of se- ven temperate, mostly turbid, estuarine and coastal ecosystems. These NDVI time-series were related to meteorological and environmental conditions. Intertidal benthic algal biomass varied seasonally in all ecosystems, in parallel with meteorology and water quality. Seasonal variation was more pro- nounced in mud than in sand. Interannual variation in biomass was small, but synchronized year- to-year biomass fluctuations occurred in a number of disjointed ecosystems. Air temperature ex- plained interannual fluctuations in biomass in a number of sites, but the synchrony was mainly driven by the wind/wave climate: high wind velocities reduced microphytobenthic biomass, ei- ther through increased resuspension or reduced emersion duration. Spatial variation in biomass was largely explained by emersion duration and mud content, both within and across ecosystems. The results imply that effects on microphytobenthic standing stock can be anticipated when the position in the tidal frame is altered, for example due to sea level rise. Increased storminess will also result in a large-scale decrease of biomass.},

   abstract = {A diatom intercomparison exercise on sampling, slide preparation, counts and identification has been carried out in September 1999 with 24 French-speaking diatomists on the River Loup (Alpes Maritimes, France). Few operators strictly respected the standard, especially for the number of individuals to be counted. It has however been demonstrated this had a very low impact on the index value and that old counts can be used for index calculation, if there are at least 300 frustules or valves. Counts higher than 400 did not lead to a better precision. The total variability largely depended on the operator and was distributed unevenly between sampling, which appears to be a critical stage, slide preparation and counting. For those who strictly respected the standard procedure, the natural variability can be estimated to about one unit value of the Biological Diatom Index. This intra-operator variability can be considered as very low, as the IBD scale is from 0 to 20, and not significant in assessing water quality. Despite this, the inter-operator variability is greater. When comparing operators' results, after excluding those who did not respect the standard requirements, the main source of variability is due to misidentifications, especially for small Achnanthes (A. minutissima and A. biasolettiana) and Cocconeis (C. placentula var. placentula, var. euglypta and var. lineata). Intercomparison exercises, internet exchanges for checking and reference material collections should be encouraged both to satisfy the internal and external quality controls and to acquaint biologists with the importance of field and laboratory protocols, as well as to allow progress in diatom identification.},

Le suivi du phytoplancton n'étant pas jugé pertinent du fait de la forte turbidité caractérisant les grands estuaires de métropole et des DOM (Guyane), il est apparu comme pertinent d’étudier la possibilité d’utiliser les peuplements du microphytobenthos (MPB) en tant qu’indicateur biologique de l’état écologique des estuaires. Ce rapport d’activité effectue la synthèse finale du projet qui s’inscrit dans le cadre d’une convention AFB/Université de Nantes. Il s’articule principalement autour de deux axes : le premier axe repose sur l’analyse de la composition spécifique du MPB, et consiste à étudier les variations de la structure des peuplements le long de gradients de perturbation, pour développer un bio-indicateur. Les peuplements sont prélevés à l’aide de carottes à microéchelle, le long de transects positionnés dans la partie poly-haline d’un estuaire. Ce rapport synthétise les principaux résultats obtenus lors des campagnes de terrain engagées sur l’estuaire de la Loire au printemps et à l’automne de l’année 2016. Les mesures de diversité du MPB sont complétées par des mesures de variables biotiques (méïofaune, macrofaune) et abiotiques (HAP, métaux lourds, nutriments). Ce premier axe comprend également l’élaboration d’une base de données historiques reposant sur les collections de Tempère et Peragallo, publiées entre 1889 et 1915, ainsi que sur l’atlas des diatomées marines benthiques des littoraux français de Peragallo & Peragallo (1897-1908). La base de données a été complétée en 2017 par des données plus récentes issues de publications, de thèse et de rapports. Le second axe correspond à une étude à macroéchelle portant sur l’analyse de la distribution spatiale et de la biomasse de MPB à l’échelle de tout un estuaire par télédétection. L’objectif est de développer des métriques issues de données mesurées à macroéchelle. Nous avons commencé à développer la méthode pour l’estuaire de la Loire tout en considérant la possibilité de l’appliquer aux 42 estuaires et baies identifiées comme des masses d’eaux de transition en France métropolitaine. Pour cela, nous avons estimé le potentiel de différents capteurs multispectraux pour cartographier les peuplements du microphytobenthos pour des estuaires de tailles variables, en tenant compte de leur résolution spatiale et spectrale. 351 taxons ont été identifiés et regroupés dans différentes formes de vie. Les espèces benthiques sont majoritaires, mais une contribution importante du phytoplancton d’eau douce est observée au printemps. Parmi les formes benthiques, les assemblages de diatomées de l’estuaire de la Loire sont dominés par des formes de vie épipéliques. Elles correspondent à de grandes diatomées mobiles qui peuvent se déplacer librement entre les particules de sédiments et former des biofilms. Les résultats des analyses multivariées entre les communautés de diatomées et les différentes formes de pressions naturelles et anthropiques, montrent que les communautés ont répondu aux pressions. Cependant, les pressions anthropiques ont eu un effet moins important que la variabilité naturelle, liée aux différences de salinité et de température. Le niveau de contamination dans les trois sites et le long des transects n’était pas aussi élévé que ce à quoi on pouvait s’attendre a priori. Une analyse de co-inertie a confirmé que les différentes formes de pressions n’apparaissaient que derrière les forçages naturels qui expliquaient le pourcentage le plus important de la variance du modèle. L'application des indices mis au point pour les cours d’eau comme l’Indice de Polluosensibilité Spécifique (IPS) a été testé avec le logiciel OMNIDIA. Tous les échantillons relevaient du mauvais état écologique. Cependant, ce classement était principalement dû au caractère halophile des espèces, qui supportent naturellement des salinités élévées en estuaire, alors que pour les cours d’eau des espèces suppportant des conductivités fortes, sont considérées comme indicatrices de milieu impacté. Une voie plus prometteuse serait de développer une méthode similaire à l’approche d'espèce de référence, où la fréquence cumulative des espèces indicatrices des conditions de référence détermine la qualité de l'eau du site (Kelly, 2013). Cependant, les tolérances aux pollutions des espèces de diatomées estuariennes et côtières sont peu connues. Ainsi, une liste générale des espèces tolérantes devrait être compilée et nous pensons que le développement de la base de données historique produite dans notre étude, ainsi que les listes actuelles des espèces de diatomées (Annexes 4 et 5) sont des premières étapes importantes. Un des livrables de ce travail est la base de données historique des diatomées benthiques de France métropolitaine réalisée sous le logiciel ACCESS. Elle doit être complétée par une centaine de références bibliographiques modernes saisies pour l’instant sur un fichier EXCEL. Pour l’approche à macroéchelle, nous avons constitué des séries temporelles de NDVI sur une période de 17 ans, démarrant en 2000, à l’aide d’images MODIS. L’information importante est qu’il a été possible de récupérer assez de données pour pouvoir appliquer la méthode d’analyse des séries temporelles basée sur le DLM (Dynamic Linear Model) (Hernández-Fariñas et al., 2013). Le MPB de la Loire a pu être mis en relation avec les variations de concentrations de nitrates et de phosphates, avec une diminution du NDVI depuis 2000, comme pour le phytoplancton. Le NDVI qui estime la biomasse du MPB de toute une masse d’eau répond donc à une forme de pression : la concentration en nutriment. C’est un premier pas vers l’élaboration d’une métrique DCE-compatible, de type percentile 90. Le capteur MODIS ne permet cependant pas d’observer les estuaires de petites tailles. Ce capteur présente pourtant des avantages importants : la gratuité des images, les corrections atmosphériques intégrées, les données d’archives disponibles depuis l’année 2000. L’exercice de comparaison inter-capteurs a mis en évidence l’intérêt de Sentinel 2 pour observer les 42 MET de France métropolitaine. Enfin, nous proposons une série de préconisations pour optimiser l’échantillonnage et réduire les sources de variabilité.},

   abstract = {The small-scale spatial distribution of Dunlin Calidris alpina staging and wintering in Bourgneuf Bay (France) was investigated on two different mudflats colo- nized by either epipsammic- or epipelic-dominated mi- crophytobenthos assemblages. Shorebird counts were conducted monthly at ebb tide from October 2011 to May 2012 and from November 2012 to May 2013. Multiple linear regressions followed by hierarchical partitioning of variance showed that microphytobenthos biomass was not a significant factor to explain Dunlin densities. However, on epipelic-dominated mudflats, Dunlins did not show their typical ‘‘tide follower’’ behaviour and instead significantly selected the highest microphytobenthos biomass zones. The biomass of a gastropod predator of an important local Dunlin prey, Retusa obtusa, was negatively correlated with Dunlin densities. This paper provides new suggestions in the ways that biofilms on mudflats affect small shorebird foraging.},

   abstract = {We investigated which variables, including environmental variables and food availability, could predict the spatial distribution and dynamics of benthic macrofauna on an intertidal flat. A time series of macrobenthos and sediment grain size samples was complemented by time series of microphytobenthos and saltmarsh vegetation biomass and sediment grain size from airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, and elevation from laser altimetry. Response models were constructed to predict biomass and species richness of macrobenthos as a function of the environmental variables. Total biomass and species richness was best predicted by a combination of microphytobenthos biomass and sediment characteristics as explanatory variables. Deep deposit feeders and surface deposit feeders also responded best to a combination of variables, with deep deposit feeders responding more strongly to sediment grain size and surface deposit feeders responding more strongly to microphytobenthos biomass. The environmental conditions to reach maximum biomass differed for each macrobenthos species. Application of the response models to the remote sensing-derived maps of the environmental variables enabled significant predictions of the spatial distribution of macrobenthos biomass, demonstrating the differences in distribution of the macrobenthos species. The models also revealed the sensitivity of the macrobenthic community to environmental change. In situ and remote sensing data demonstrated a significant fining of the sediment and a (temporal) increase in average microphytobenthos biomass. Field observations also showed a significant increase in species richness and changes in the relative abundance of species, with a decrease in Bathyporeia pilosa, and an increase in Nereis diversicolor, Pygospio elegans and Heteromastus filiformis. Such changes in macrobenthos biomass and species richness were indeed predicted from the response models. The study demonstrates that the synoptic remote sensing techniques combined with field sampling allow efficient ecological mapping and monitoring.},

Satellite platforms provide a most convenient tool to observe the biosphere globally and repetitively, but the quantitative interpretation of the observations may be difficult. Reflectance measurements in the visible and near-infrared regions have been analyzed with simple but powerful indices designed to enhance the contrast between the vegetation and other surface types, however, these indices are rather sensitive to atmospheric effects. The 'correction' of satellite data for atmospheric effects is possible but requires large data sets on the composition of the atmosphere. Instead, we propose a new vegetation index which has been designed specifically to reduce the relative effects of these undesirable atmospheric perturbations, while maintaining the information about the vegetation cover. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

   abstract = {An atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) is proposed and developed for remote sensing of vegetation from the Earth Observing System (EOS) MODIS sensor. The same index can be used for remote sensing from Landsat TM and the EOS-HIRIS sensor. The index takes advantage of the presence of the blue channel (0.47.±0.01 μm) in the MODIS sensor, in addition to the red (0.66±0.025 μm) and the near-IR (0.865±0.02 μm) channels that compose the present normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The resistance of the ARVI to atmospheric effects (in comparison to the NDVI) is accomplished by a self-correction process for the atmospheric effect on the red channel, using the difference in the radiance between the blue and the red channels to correct the radiance in the red channel. Simulations using radiative transfer computations on arithmetic and natural surface spectra, for various atmospheric conditions, show that ARVI has a similar dynamic range to the NDVI, but is, on average, four times less sensitive to atmospheric effects than the NDVI},

   abstract = {This paper outlines the first part of a series of research studies to investigate the potential and approaches for using optical remote sensing to assess vegetation water content. It first analyzes why most methods used as approximations of vegetation water content (such as vegetation stress indices, estimation of degree of curing and chlorophyll content) are not suitable for retrieving water content at leaf level. It then documents the physical basis supporting the use of remote sensing to directly detect vegetation water content in terms of Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) at leaf level. Using laboratory measurements, the radiative transfer model PROSPECT and a sensitivity analysis, it shows that shortwave infrared (SWIR) is sensitive to EWT but cannot be used alone to retrieve EWT because two other leaf parameters (internal structure and dry matter) also influence leaf reflectance in the SWIR. A combination of SWIR and NIR (only influenced by these two parameters) is necessary to retrieve EWT at leaf level. These results set the basis towards establishing operational techniques for the retrieval of EWT at top-of-canopy and top-of-atmospheric levels. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Acquiring and building Digital Outcrop Models (DOM) becomes an essential approach in geosciences. This study highlights the strong potential of Structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry for full-3D mapping of inaccessible outcrops, combining pictures captured from field and from unmanned aerial vehicle-embedded digital cameras. We present a workflow for (i) acquiring and reconstructing a DOM of a geometrically complex natural cave site using digital photogrammetry in a lowlight environment, (ii) georeferencing the 3D model in underground environments, (iii) identifying and characterizing the geometry of inaccessible geological structures and their tectonic kinematics (e.g., faults, joints, sedimentary bedding planes, slickenlines) for structural geology purposes. We illustrate our method by modelling a challenging case study: the main chamber of the Lorette cave (Rochefort Cave Laboratory, Belgium). First, we produced a high resolution, highly realistic model made of 395 million points cloud. This allowed to draw a detailed lithostratigraphic log of the exposed sedimentary pile, alternating decimetric carbonate mudstones with minor centimetric clay-rich layers. Secondly, we extract the orientation of brittle structures from the cave DOM which consist of joints, calcite-filled veins, fault planes with observable slickenlines and their kinematic indicators. Calcitic veins consist of tension gashes structures. Two subsets of tension gashes are distinguished based on their orientation (WNW-striking with low-vs subhorizontal dips) and morphology (planar vs en-echelon sigmoidal veins). Two faults subsets are identified: (i) a first one comprises south-dipping fault planes with mean strike-dip of N069-S42 and consist of bedding surface slip; (ii) a second one which corresponds to neoformed north-dipping faults (mean strike-dip: N279-N60). We recognize and characterize tectonic markers on fault planes directly from the high-resolution DOM (slickenlines and asymmetrical microscarps) pointing to a reverse shearing movement for all investigated faults. Based on their geometrical relations and fault-slip data, paleostress reconstruction points to a NW-SE to NNW-SSE sub-horizontal compressive regime. This one is interpreted as the record of early phases of Variscan tectonics during the fold-to-fault progression. This research paper also highlights future possibilities for rapid semi-automatic interpretation of such 3D dataset for structural geology purposes as well as advances in technology and perspectives in terms of risk assessments and mitigation.},

Pour le total des sites où la prolifération est importante, elle a atteint 20 000 t de poids frais en 1997 au moment de son maximum. Ces “marées vertes” ont lieu tous les ans à peu près aux mêmes endroits. Elles constituent une nuisance très importante pour le tourisme local. Dans beaucoup de communes concernées les algues échouées et pourrissantes sont ramassées et évacuées (43 000 m3 au total en 1997). L’essentiel de la croissance des algues se tient entre la zone de déferlement et le sable découvert. La prolifération requiert trois conditions simultanées : 1) une plage sableuse de faible pente, 2) un courant résiduel faible (c’est-à-dire après filtrage du va-et-vient de la marée), 3) un flux d’azote même modéré (ammoniaque ou nitrate). Les formes intensives de l’agriculture sont de loin les causes principales des flux croissants d’azote sur les sites de marée verte. Cette prolifération d’ulves a été modélisée dans deux baies bretonnes. La tendance actuelle du phénomène est à l’aggravation, plutôt visible dans des zones plus profondes, au-delà de celle du déferlement. L’impact écologique n’est pas encore établi},

The Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard each platform is identically designed. However, as indicated by spectral response function (SRF), there is channel difference (more or less) between two MSIs. An investigation to show comparison of Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B in terms of channel reflectance and derived spectral index was conducted accordingly. The preliminary results mainly based on ASTER Spectral Library Version 2.0 are shown. Findings are included: (1) channel reflectance of Sentinel-2A MSI is averagely greater than channel reflectance of Sentinel-2B MSI over most channels; (2) the difference in channel reflectance is more significant for B1 (Costal Aerosol), B2 (Blue), and B12 (SWIR); (3) the difference in derived spectral index (i.e., NDVI) is more significant, compared with the difference in reflectance of individual channels correspondingly. To ensure the product consistency between two MSIs, investigations based on more spectra collections and actual observation},

We had an amazing number of manuscripts submitted this year for the PBRN issue; as a result, this is a powerful issue. Some are under revision for future issues of the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, just as we have some articles from PBRNs appearing in most issues. PBRNs have deepened the family medicine research tradition. The importance of primary care research to build the evidence base of our clinical practice, plus the useful work building the methods of primary care research, distinguishes the pioneers in PBRNs. PBRNs are Health Improvement Networks and national treasures to be nurtured.},

The problem of breaking up the treatment means into distinguishable groups has not been discussed at much length, the solutions given in the various textbooks differ and, what is more important, seem solely based on intuition. After discussing the problem on a basis combining intuition with some hard, cold facts about the distributions of certain test quantities (or "statistics") a simple and definite procedure is proposed for dividing treatments into distinguishable groups, and for determining that the treatments within some of these groups are different, although there is not enough evidence to say "which is which." The procedure is illustrated on examples.},

In just what sense distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in most approaches, thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete. Our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically related. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis. Our technique of multidimensional scaling is to compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit.

   abstract = {Distributions of microphytobenthos are highly heterogeneous at scales as small as a few centimetres. However, the sampling protocols currently used for the absolute determination of microphytobenthos biomass through chlorophyll a concentration measurements in surface sediments are too limited to take this variability into account, typically relying on 3-5 samples taken within a randomly located 1 m2 quadrat in a given environment. We address this issue by objectively and quantitatively inferring the minimum number of samples required to obtain reliable estimates of microphytobenthos biomass on the basis of high-resolution sub-sampling (225 regularly spaced samples) within each of nine 1 m2 quadrats at an unvegetated sheltered intertidal sandbank of the Gold Coast (Queensland, Australia). The results were generalised using data obtained in previous studies on an exposed sandy shore and on sheltered estuarine sandy muds of the Eastern English Channel. Estimates of chlorophyll a concentration exhibited a high degree of heterogeneity, both between and within quadrats. The number of samples needed to estimate the average chlorophyll a concentration, and hence mean microphytobenthos biomass with 95% confidence intervals, ranged from 15 to 115, and mainly depended on the presence of global and local gradients within the quadrats. These results have major implications for intertidal ecology by implying a possible systematic bias in the measurement of both microphytobenthos biomass and production of up to 40%. Finally, we emphasise that this issue can be circumvented using field spectrometry or PAM fluorescence measurements coupled with traditional sediment sampling techniques, and urge for unified protocols to be adopted for the routine use of these combined methods. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Abstract In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi‐species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others, Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often‐quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self‐consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically‐relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example ‘sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C’. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non‐parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.

   abstract = {Introduction Diatoms are an important and often dominant component of benthic microalgal assemblages in estuarine and shallow coastal environments. This chapter will be concerned mainly with motile diatom assemblages on sediments in these environments and secondarily with epiphytic diatom assemblages on submerged aquatic vegetation. Admiraal (1984) provided an excellent summary of the ecology of estuarine sediment-inhabiting diatoms and Underwood and Kromkamp (1999) an excellent review of microphytobenthos primary production in estuaries. Many topics were covered in the above two works, including the distribution, effects of physicochemical factors, population growth, primary production, and interactions with herbivores in Admiraal’s work, and a summary of the main factors affecting production and biomass of microphytobenthos (diatom-dominated) within microtidal temperate estuaries in Underwood and Kromkamp’s review. The focus of the present review will be considerably narrower because only those applied studies that have focused on the autecology of particular diatom species or that have utilized structural (e.g. species diversity) and/or functional (e.g. primary production rates) attributes of benthic diatom assemblages will be considered. By “applied” we mean studies that treat benthic diatom assemblages as tools to address concerns about larger ecosystem problems such as cultural eutrophication of estuarine and shallow coastal environments. The three diatom-related research topics that will be reviewed in this chapter include eutrophication and sediment toxicity, sediment stability, and contribution of benthic diatom assemblages to global primary production and their role in food webs.},

   abstract = {The problem of identifying subtle time-space clustering of disease, as may be occurring in leukemia, is described and reviewed. Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leukemia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n(n −1)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal trans form to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed association be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given. While the distance measures between points represent symmetric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regularities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for arbitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the ease of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general procedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extending it to nonlinear and multivariate situations is suggested. Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed. © 1967, American Association for Cancer Research. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Abstract Diatoms frequently dominate marine and freshwater biofilms as major primary producers. Nutrient resources in these biofilms are patchily distributed and fluctuate dynamically over time. We recently reported that this spatially and temporally structured environment can be exploited by motile diatoms that use chemoattraction to dissolved silicate (dSi) under Si starvation. Here, we show that the behavioral response of diatoms is more complex and selective as cells are also responding to gradients of dissolved phosphate (dP) when starved in this nutrient. In contrast, neither nitrate nor ammonium (dN) triggers an attractive response under nitrogen limitation. Video monitoring and movement pattern analysis of the model diatom Seminavis robusta revealed that dP attraction is mediated by a combined chemokinetic and chemotactic response. After locating nutrient hotspots, the microalgae slow down and recover from the limitation. The fastest recovery in terms of growth was observed after dSi limitation. In agreement with the lack of directional response, recovery from dN limitation was slowest, indicating that no short-term benefit would be drawn by the algae from the location of transient hotspots of this resource. Our results highlight the ability of diatoms to adapt to nutrient limitation by active foraging and might explain their success in patchy benthic environments.},

   abstract = {Excessive nutrient loading of water bodies is a leading cause of water pollution worldwide, and controlling nutrient levels in watersheds is a primary objective of most environmental policy. Over the past two decades, much research has shown that ecosystems with more species are more efficient at removing nutrients from soil and water than are ecosystems with fewer species. This has led some to suggest that conservation of biodiversity might be a useful tool for managing nutrient uptake and storage, but this suggestion has been controversial, in part because the specific biological mechanisms by which species diversity influences nutrient uptake have not been identified. Here I use a model system of stream biofilms to show that niche partitioning among species of algae can increase the uptake and storage of nitrate, a nutrient pollutant of global concern. I manipulated the number of species of algae growing in the biofilms of 150 stream mesocosms that had been set up to mimic the variety of flow habitats and disturbance regimes that are typical of natural streams. Nitrogen uptake rates, as measured by using (15)N-labelled nitrate, increased linearly with species richness and were driven by niche differences among species. As different forms of algae came to dominate each unique habitat in a stream, the more diverse communities achieved a higher biomass and greater (15)N uptake. When these niche opportunities were experimentally removed by making all of the habitats in a stream uniform, diversity did not influence nitrogen uptake, and biofilms collapsed to a single dominant species. These results provide direct evidence that communities with more species take greater advantage of the niche opportunities in an environment, and this allows diverse systems to capture a greater proportion of biologically available resources such as nitrogen. One implication is that biodiversity may help to buffer natural ecosystems against the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diatom cell wall, called the frustule, is predominantly made out of silica, in many cases with highly ordered nano- and micro-scale features. Frustules are built intracellularly inside a special compartment, the silica deposition vesicle, or SDV. Molecules such as proteins (silaffins and silacidins) and long chain polyamines have been isolated from the silica and shown to be involved in the control of the silica polymerization. However, we are still unable to explain or reproduce in vitro the complexity of structures formed by diatoms. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDING: In this study, using fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, we were able to compare and correlate microtubules and microfilaments with silica structure formed in diversely structured diatom species. The high degree of correlation between silica structure and actin indicates that actin is a major element in the control of the silica morphogenesis at the meso and microscale. Microtubules appear to be involved in the spatial positioning on the mesoscale and strengthening of the SDV. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results reveal the importance of top down control over positioning of and within the SDV during diatom wall formation and open a new perspective for the study of the mechanism of frustule patterning as well as for the understanding of the control of membrane dynamics by the cytoskeleton.},

BIOENV analysis revealed that, in study period, temperature, salinity, silicate and total phosphorus were the variables that best explained the phytoplankton spatial pattern in the estuary (Spearman correlation, rho=0.803). A generalized linear model (GLM) also identified salinity, silicate and phosphate as having a high explanatory power (63%) of phytoplankton abundance. These selected nutrients appear to be consistent with the requirements of the dominant phytoplankton group, Baccilariophyceae.

A functional trait framework has been proposed to improve the mechanistic understanding of this relationship, but this has rarely been tested for organisms other than plants. We analysed eight datasets, including five animal groups, to examine how well a trait-based approach, compared with a more traditional taxonomic approach, predicts seven ecosystem functions below- and above-ground. Trait-based indices consistently provided greater explanatory power than species richness or abundance. The frequency distributions of single or multiple traits in the community were the best predictors of ecosystem functioning. This implies that the ecosystem functions we investigated were underpinned by the combination of trait identities (i.e. single-trait indices) and trait complementarity (i.e. multi-trait indices) in the communities. Our study provides new insights into the general mechanisms that link biodiversity to ecosystem functioning in natural animal communities and suggests that the observed responses were due to the identity and dominance patterns of the trait composition rather than the number or abundance of species per se.},

There is a close agreement between the proportions of species in the five AMBI ecological groups and a phylum level meta-analysis axis of increasing environmental impact. All AMBI measures provide a better monotonic relationship with the impact axis than do traditional species diversity measures, which show higher diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance. A marginally better relationship with the impact axis of the meta-analysis is achieved by a moderate (square root) transformation of the data. 'Production' data (an appropriate combination of abundance and biomass information) provide only a marginal improvement on abundance data, but are ecologically and functionally much more relevant. Severe transformation of the data, culminating in presence/absence, degrades the relationship with the impact axis, but if only simple species lists are available then these may still be useable in making an environmental assessment.},

   abstract = {Composition and distribution of planktonic protists were examined relative to microbial food web dynamics (growth, grazing, and nitrogen cycling rates) at the Old Woman Creek (OWC) National Estuarine Research Reserve during an episodic storm event in July 2003. More than 150 protistan taxa were identified based on morphology. Species richness and microbial biomass measured via microscopy and flow cytometry increased along a stream-lake (Lake Erie) transect and peaked at the confluence. Water column ammonium (NH4+) uptake (0.06 to 1.82 microM N h(-1)) and regeneration (0.04 to 0.55 microM N h(-1)) rates, measured using 15NH4+ isotope dilution, followed the same pattern. Large light/dark NH4+ uptake differences were observed in the hypereutrophic OWC interior, but not at the phosphorus-limited Lake Erie site, reflecting the microbial community structural shift from net autotrophic to net heterotrophic. Despite this shift, microbial grazers (mostly choreotrich ciliates, taxon-specific growth rates up to 2.9 d(-1)) controlled nanophytoplankton and bacteria at all sites by consuming 76 to 110% and 56 to 97% of their daily production, respectively, in dilution experiments. Overall, distribution patterns and dynamics of microbial communities in OWC resemble those in marine estuaries, where plankton productivity increases along the river-sea gradient and reaches its maximum at the confluence.},

The combination of geographical, environmental and chemical data included in the study explained all of the variation observed within the diatom communities. The chemical data, particularly metal concentrations, explained 45.9% of variation in the diatom communities, once the effects of grain-size and spatial structure had been excluded. Of the metals, tin explained the greatest proportion of variation in the diatom communities (28%). Tin was very highly correlated (R2>0.95) with several other variables (copper, iron, lead, and sum of metals), all of which explained similarly high proportions of total variation. Grain-size data explained 23% of variation once the effects of spatial structure and the chemical data had been excluded. The pure spatial component explained only 1.8% of the total variance. The study demonstrates that much of the compositional variability observed in the bay can be explained by concentrations of metal contaminants.},

   abstract = {Diatom indices are used to evaluate the ecological status of rivers but they have been rarely applied in estuaries. This study aimed to identify the diatom species indicating the main environmental gradients and pressures in a highly stratified estuary; and to evaluate the applicability of existing freshwater diatom indices. Marine influence due to salt-wedge intrusion and sea water mixing appeared as the main factor affecting diatom community. Three diatom assemblages were identified: indicators of riverine conditions (without marine influence), indicators of estuarine conditions (heterogeneous conditions with higher conductivities due to marine influence) and those specifically indicating well-established salt-wedge situations. Nowadays, the main human pressure affecting diatom community in the Ebro Estuary is the hydrological alteration resulting from flow regulation and abstraction. Several limitations were encountered in the application of diatom indices (e.g. inverse response with nutrients; ecologically important species not considered). Therefore, their use in estuaries should be done cautiously.},

   abstract = {Diatoms contribute to a substantial portion of primary production in the oceans and many lakes. Owing to their relatively heavy cell walls and high nutrient requirements, planktonic diatoms are expected to decrease with climate warming because of reduced nutrient redistribution and increasing sinking velocities. Using a historical dataset, this study shows that diatoms were able to maintain their biovolume with increasing stratification in Lake Tahoe over the last decades; however, the diatom community structure changed. Increased stratification and reduced nitrogen to phosphorus ratios selected for small-celled diatoms, particularly within the Cyclotella genus. An empirical model showed that a shift in phytoplankton species composition and cell size was consistent within different depth strata, indicating that altered nutrient concentrations were not responsible for the change. The increase in small-celled species was sufficient to decrease the average diatom size and thus sinking velocity, which strongly influences energy transfer through the food web and carbon cycling. Our results show that within the diverse group of diatoms, small-sized species with a high surface area to volume ratio were able to adapt to a decrease in mixing intensity, supporting the hypotheses that abiotic drivers affect the size structure of planktonic communities and that warmer climate favours small-sized diatom cells.},

We will first discuss the techniques for analysing stable isotopes in biomarkers, primarily gas chromatography-combustion–isotope ratio mass spectrometry, and then describe a number of applications in microbial ecology based on 13C. Natural abundance isotope ratios of biomarkers can be used to study organic matter sources utilised by microorganisms in complex ecosystems and for identifying specific groups of bacteria like methanotrophs. Addition of labelled substrates in combination with biomarker analysis enables direct identification of microbes involved in specific processes and also allows for the incorporation of bacteria into food web studies. We believe that the full potential of the technique in microbial ecology has just started to be exploited.},

   abstract = {Stable isotope and ecological stoichiometry investigations of aquatic food webs require separate measurements of microalgae and detritus, but fine particulate matter collected as seston or scraped from biofilms typically is an unknown mixture of these two components plus other material. This paper describes an economical method to partition fine particulate matter into predominantly algal and detrital components by centrifugation in colloidal silica. Centrifugation using this density also worked well to separate algae from inorganic matter. The protocol was tested by sampling a broad range of water bodies in Queensland, Australia. Seston was concentrated using an inexpensive continuous centrifuge and organic matter was collected from surfaces of rocks, mud, or plants. Separation in colloidal silica was achieved using a standard benchtop centrifuge. When the colloidal silica was adjusted to a density of 1.27 g/cm3, the light fraction (supernatant) tended to be dominated by algal organic matter while the heavy fraction tended to be more detrital. Ratios of organic carbon to chlorophyll a indicated the efficacy of the separations. Stable C and N isotope ratios often differed considerably between the algal and detrital fractions, demonstrating the need to perform such separations in many aquatic environments.},

@article{Clarke1994,
   abstract = {The large, sparse arrays of species counts arising in both field and experimental community studies do not lend themselves to standard statistical tests based on multivariate normality. Instead, a valid and more revealing approach uses informal display methods, such as clustering or multi-dimensional scaling ordination (MDS), based on a biologically-motivated definition of pairwise similarity of samples in terms of species composition. Formal testing methods are still required, however, to establish that real assemblage differences exist between sites, times, experimental treatments, pollution states, etc. Earlier work has described a range of Manteltype permutation or randomisation procedures, making no distributional assumptions, which are termed ANOSIM tests because of their dependence only on (rank) similarities and the analogy to one and two-way ANOVA. This paper extends these tests to cover an important practical case, previously unconsidered, that of a two-way layoutwithout replication. Such cases arise for single samples (or pseudo-replicates) taken in a baseline monitoring survey of several sites over time, or a mesocosm experiment in which “treatments” are replicated only once within each experimental “block”. Significance tests are given for the overall presence of a treatment (or time) effect, based on a measure of concordance between rank similarities of samples within each block (or site); the role of the two factors can be reversed to obtain a test for block effects. As in the analogous univariate ANOVA test, the method relies on absence or relative weakness of treatment x block “interactions”. Its scope is illustrated with data from two experimental and two field studies, involving meiofaunal communities from soft-sediment and macro-algal habitats. It is seen also to accommodate a modest derree of missing data. Whilst the failure to replicate adequately is not encouraged—a richer inference is available with genuine replication—the paper does provide a limited way forward for hypothesis testing in the absence of replicates.},

   abstract = {Tests for null hypotheses of 'absence of structure' should play an important role in any exploratory study, to guard against interpretation of sample patterns that could have been obtained by chance, and two new tests of this type are described. In the multivariate analyses that arise in community ecology and many other environmental contexts, e.g. in linking assemblage patterns to forcing environmental variables (gradient analysis), the problem of chance associations is exacerbated by the large number of combinations of abiotic variables that can usually be examined. A test which allows for this selection bias is described (the global BEST test), which applies to any dissimilarity measure, utilises only rank dissimilarities, and operates by permutation, assuming no specific distributional form or parametric expression for the biotic to abiotic links. A second permutation procedure, the similarity profile routine (SIMPROF), tests for the presence of sample groups (or more continuous sample patterns) in a priori unstructured sets of samples, for which an a priori structured test (e.g. the widely-used ANOSIM) is invalid. One context is in interpreting dendrograms from hierarchical cluster analyses: a series of SIMPROF tests provides objective stopping rules for ever-finer dissection into subgroups. Connecting these two tests is a third methodological strand, adapting De'ath's multivariate equivalent of univariate CART analysis (Classification And Regression Trees) to a non-parametric context. This produces a divisive, constrained, hierarchical cluster analysis of samples, based on their assemblage data, termed a linkage tree. The constraint is that each binary division of the tree corresponds to a threshold on one of the environmental variables and, consistently with related non-parametric routines, maximises the high-dimensional separation of the two groups, as measured by the ANOSIM R statistic. Such linkage trees therefore provide abiotic 'explanations' for each biotic subdivision of the samples but, as with unconstrained clustering, the LINKTREE routine requires objective stopping rules to avoid over-interpretation, these again being provided by a sequence of SIMPROF tests. The inter-connectedness of these three new developments is illustrated by data from the literature of marine ecology.},

   abstract = {The evolution of eutrophication parameters (i.e., nutrients and phytoplankton biomass) during recent decades was examined in coastal waters of the Vilaine Bay (VB, France) in relation to changes in the Loire and Vilaine rivers. Dynamic linear models were used to study long-term trends and seasonality of dissolved inorganic nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl a) in rivers and coastal waters. For the period 1997-2013, the reduction in dissolved riverine inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations led to the decrease in their Chl a levels. However, while dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations decreased only slightly in the Vilaine, they increased in the Loire, specifically in summer. Simultaneously, phytoplankton in the VB underwent profound changes with increase in biomass and change in the timing of the annual peak from spring to summer. The increase in phytoplankton biomass in the VB, manifested particularly by increased summer diatom abundances, was due to enhanced summer DIN loads from the Loire, sustained by internal regeneration of DIP and dissolved silicate (DSi) from sediments. The long-term trajectories of this case study evidence that significant reduction of P inputs without simultaneous N abatement was not yet sufficient to control eutrophication all along the Loire-Vilaine-VB continuum. Upstream rivers reveal indices of recoveries following the significant diminution of P, while eutrophication continues to increase downstream, especially when N is the limiting factor. More N input reduction, paying particular attention to diffuse N sources, is required to control eutrophication in receiving VB coastal waters. Internal benthic DIP and DSi recycling appears to have contributed to the worsening of summer VB water quality, augmenting the effects of anthropogenic DIN inputs. For this coastal ecosystem, nutrient management strategies should consider the role played by internal nutrient loads to tackle eutrophication processes.},

   abstract = {Benthic microalgae include pennate and centric diatoms, cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, and other microscopic algae living at the sediment/water interface in neritic ecosystems. Increasingly, numerous studies have now documented microalgal production, biomass, and other aspects of their ecology in much of the world's neritic habitats, although substantial gaps in the geographical and depth distributions of these studies remain. Analysis of 85 studies of benthic microalgal production yields a global estimate of annual benthic microalgal productivity of about 500 million tons of carbon, somewhat higher than previous estimates. Information on the depth distribution and compensation light intensity for benthic microalgae suggests that in many areas productive benthic microalgae extend to depths well below those where they have been studied. The high biomass concentrations attained by benthic microalgae at the sediment/water interface reflect a variety of adaptations and selective advantages likely to result from those adaptations. Stabilization of the sediment surface by microalgal growth and extrapolymeric substance production is an important feature of the ecology of benthic microalgae. Regulation of nutrient fluxes, gas exchange, and redox conditions may result from microalgal stabilization of the sediments and create conditions more favourable to microalgal growth. Grazing and physical perturbations can act to disrupt the stabilizing effects of microalgal growth on the sediment surface. These ideas are presented as a new paradigm that proposes a key role for benthic microalgae in neritic ecosystems along a spectrum of light limitation and physical disturbance.},

Simultaneously, the Chlorophyll a biomass of Z. noltii leaves, associated epiphytes and sediment within the benthic chambers were also monitored. The significant positive exponential relationship established between R and the maximum daily temperature emphasized that temperature was a good predictor of seasonal variation in the community R in Z. noltii bed. In contrast, the amplitude of the fitted curve on GPP was low and represented <25% of the annual mean value (90.9 ± 15.2 mgC m−2 h−1). The Chlorophyll a biomass of sediment was high (133.70 ± 22.96 mg m−2) but it was likely constituted by detritus which did not contribute much to the community GPP. The Chlorophyll a biomass of associated epiphytes was higher in winter and varied over the year inversely with Z. noltii. Therefore, the asynchronous dynamic of primary producers could support a constant rate of production at community scale over the year.},

   abstract = {According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the status of European surface waters is assessed using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30%), coastal waters (26%), lakes (25%) and transitional waters (19%). More than half of the methods are based on macroscopic plants (28%) or benthic invertebrates (26%); in addition, phytoplankton (21%), fish (15%) and phytobenthos (10%) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class- or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other water categories abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton &gt; phytobenthos &gt; macroscopic plants &gt; benthic invertebrates &gt; fish fauna. The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants &gt; benthic invertebrates &gt; phytoplankton &gt; phytobenthos. These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and transitional waters. The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for transitional waters being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and water categories. The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range (&lt;0.4 to &gt;0.8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton &gt; macroscopic plants &gt; benthic invertebrates &gt; phytobenthos and fish fauna. In terms of water categories the following order resulted: coastal waters &gt; lakes &gt; transitional waters &gt; rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches. We advocate better reflection of the necessary sampling effort and precision, full validations of pressure-impact relationships and an implementation of more ecological components into classification.},

   abstract = {Assessing the stocks and flows of ecosystem services valued by society is crucial to ensure the sustainable management of marine ecosystems, as required by the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD; EC, 2008). The mapping of these ecosystem services enhances the flow of information from researchers to practitioners, contributing to a better management of ecosystem services. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, a screening and evaluation of available open source spatial databases was conducted to assess their usefulness to map European coastal and marine ecosystem services. Second, these spatial databases were classified according to the DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, Status, Impacts, Responses) framework and the MSFD descriptors to assess how this information can inform decision-makers. The supply of explicit spatial information was used as main screening criteria and allowed to identify 581 existing databases. These databases were then categorised according to a set of criteria (including data collection methods and updating frequency) related with their usefulness to be applied to map ecosystem services. The databases that did not meet the selected criteria (e.g. no explicit spatial information) were discarded. This process allowed to identify 329 spatial databases useful for coastal and marine ecosystem services mapping in Europe. The databases were then distinguished based on the ability to work the data on a GIS software, identifying 193 databases that allowed further analysis (hereafter applicable), and 136 databases that do not allow the extraction of data (hereafter non-applicable). The applicable spatial databases were further linked to the i) CICES framework for ecosystem services classification, ii) DPSIR framework and iii) descriptors considered in the MSFD. The obtained results showed that 42% of the spatial databases can be useful to map regulation services, followed by provision (33%) and cultural (21%) services. Considering the DPSIR framework, more than half can be used as proxies to evaluate coastal and marine ecosystems status (66%), followed by proxies of pressures (18%), drivers (8%), responses (4%), and finally impacts (4%). The available databases represent in a better way MSFD descriptors related to Hydrogeological conditions (D7), Eutrophication (D5), and Biodiversity (D1), being the non-indigenous species (D2) and contaminants in seafood (D9) descriptors somehow underrepresented. The obtained findings highlight the spatial open data limitations and challenges when mapping coastal and marine ecosystem services and contribute to the identification of spatial data gaps and opportunities when aiming for the sustainable management of marine ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Sublittoral macrobenthic communities in the Skomer Marine Nature Reserve (SMNR), Pembrokeshire, Wales, were sampled at 10 stations in 1993, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2007 and 2009 using a Day grab and a 0.5 mm mesh. The time series is analysed using Similarities Profiles (SIMPROF) tests and associated methods. Q-mode analysis using clustering with Type 1 SIMPROF addresses multivariate structure among samples, showing that there is clear structure associated with differences among years. Inverse (r-mode) analysis using Type 2 SIMPROF decisively rejects a hypothesis that species are not associated with each other. Clustering of the variables (species) with Type 3 SIMPROF identifies groups of species which covary coherently through the time-series. The time-series is characterised by a dramatic decline in abundances and diversity between the 1993 and 1996 surveys. By 1998 there had been a shift in community composition from the 1993 situation, with different species dominating. Communities had recovered in terms of abundance and species richness, but different species dominated the community. No single factor could be identified which unequivocally explained the dramatic changes observed in the SMNR. Possible causes were the effects of dispersed oil and dispersants from the Sea Empress oil spill in February 1996 and the cessation of dredge-spoil disposal off St Annes Head in 1995, but the most likely cause was severe weather. With many species, and a demonstrable recovery from an impact, communities within the SMNR appear to be diverse and resilient. If attributable to natural storms, the changes observed here indicate that natural variability may be much more important than is generally taken into account in the design of monitoring programmes.},

   abstract = {abstract: The discipline of evolutionary protistology has emerged in the past 30 yr. There is as yet no agreed view of how protists are interrelated or how they should be classified. The foundations of a stable taxonomic superstructure for the protists and other eukaryotes lie in cataloging the diversity of the major monophyletic lineages of these organisms. The use of common patterns of cell organization (ultrastructural identity) seems to provide us with the most robust hypotheses of such lineages. These lineages are placed in 71 groups without identifiable sister taxa. These groups are here referred to as major building blocks. For the first time, the compositions, ultrastructural identities, synapomorphies (where available), and subgroups of the major building blocks are summarized. More than 200 further lineages without clear identities are listed. This catalog includes all known major elements of the comprehensive evolutionary tree of protists and eukaryotes. Different approaches among protistologists to issues of nomenclature, ranking, and definitions of these groups are discussed, with particular reference to two groups--the stramenopiles and the Archezoa. The concept of extended in-group is introduced to refer to in-groups and the most proximate sister group and to assist in identifying the hierarchical location of taxa.},

   abstract = {Although single-species laboratory toxicity tests with microalgae are sensitive and highly reproducible, they lack environmental realism. Interactions between algae and their associated bacteria, either in the plankton or in biofilms, may alter algal sensitivity to contaminants, which are not mimicked in laboratory toxicity tests. This study investigated the effects of simple algal-bacterial relationships on the sensitivity of laboratory-cultured algae to copper using 72-h algal growth-rate inhibition bioassays. Four species of microalgae were used, two isolates of each; a strain of algae with no microscopically visible and no culturable bacteria present (operationally defined as axenic) and a non-axenic strain. The four algae used were the marine diatom Nitzschia closterium, the freshwater green alga Pseudokirchnerielia subcapitata and two tropical Chlorella spp. Under control conditions (no copper), N. closterium and P. subcapitata grew better in the presence of the bacterial community. Sensitivity to copper (assessed as the concentration to inhibit the growth rate by 50% after 72-h (IC50)) was not significantly different for the axenic and non-axenic strains of N. closterium, A subcapitata or for Chlorella sp. (PNG isolate). At pH 5.7, the axenic Chlorella sp. (NT isolate) had a 72-h IC50 of 46 mu g Cu L-1, while in the presence of bacteria the IC50 increased (i.e., sensitivity decreased) to 208 mu g Cu L-1. However, when the bacterial status of both the operationally defined axenic and non-axenic cultures of N. closterium and Chlorella sp. (NT isolate) was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 16S rRNA followed by DNA fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), it was found that bacteria were actually present in all the algal cultures, i.e. the axenic cultures were not truly bacteria-free. Based on sequence information, the bacteria present were nearly all identified as alphaproteobacteria, and a number of isolates had high similarity to bacteria previously identified as symbionts or species endophytically associated with marine organisms. The "axenic" cultures contained less bacterial phylotypes than the non-axenic cultures, and based on band-intensity, also contained less bacterial DNA. This supported the findings of few differences in copper sensitivity between strains, and suggests that standard microalgal toxicity tests probably inadvertently use non-axenic cultures in metal assessment. 0 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Power laws describe empirical scaling relationships that are emergent quantitative features of biodiversity. These features are patterns of structure or dynamics that are self-similar or fractal-like over many orders of magnitude. Power laws allow extrapolation and prediction over a wide range of scales. Some appear to be universal, occurring in virtually all taxa of organisms and types of environments. They offer clues to underlying mechanisms that powerfully constrain biodiversity. We describe recent progress and future prospects for understanding the mechanisms that generate these power laws, and for explaining the diversity of species and complexity of ecosystems in terms of fundamental principles of physical and biological science.},

   abstract = {A Bayesian analysis of a seven gene data set was conducted to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among a sample of centric and pennate diatoms and to test alternative hypotheses about the closest living relative of Bacillariophyceae. A lineage, composed of two Attheya species, was inferred to share the most recent common ancestor with Bacillariophyceae--a relationship that was also corroborated by the combined parsimony analysis. All competing hypotheses about the closest living relative of Bacillariophyceae were rejected because 100% of the trees in the post-burn-in sample in the Bayesian analysis supported the Attheya-Bacillariophyceae clade. According to a partitioned Bremer support analysis, the majority of the genes in the combined data matrix supported the Attheya--Bacillariophyceae relationship. The global topology of the phylogenetic tree indicated that a monophyletic group consisting of Thalassiosirales and Toxarium undulatum formed the deepest branch followed by a node uniting a clade composed of Bacillariophyceae/Attheya species and a lineage made up of Eucampia zoodiacus, Chaetocerotales, Lithodesmiales, Triceratiales, Biddulphiales and Cymatosirales. Except for the phylogenetic positions of Lithodesmiales, Thalassiosira sp and Skeletonema costatum, the optimal tree obtained from the combined parsimony analysis showed the same branching order of taxa as those seen in the consensus tree inferred from three independent Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses. Noteworthy findings are that Toxarium undulatum shares a strongly supported node with Thalassiosirales and that the genus Attheya is not a member of the Chaetocerotales lineage.},

   abstract = {In multivariate analyses of the effects of both natural and anthropogenic environmental variability on community composition, many species are interchangeable in the way that they characterise the samples, giving rise to the concept of structural redundancy in community composition. Here, we develop a method of quantifying the extent of this redundancy by extracting a series of subsets of species, the multivariate response pattern of each of which closely matches that for the whole community. Structural redundancy is then reflected in the number of such subsets, which we term “response units”, that can be extracted without replacement. We have applied this technique to the effects of the Amoco-Cadiz oil-spill on marine macrobenthos in the Bay of Morlaix, France, and to the natural interannual variability of macrobenthos at two stations off the coast of Northumberland, England. Structural redundancy is shown to be remarkably high, with the number and sizes of subsets being comparable in all three examples. Taxonomic/functional groupings of species within the differing response units change in abundance in the same way over time. The response units are shown to possess a wide taxonomic spread and, using two different types of randomisation test, demonstrated to have a taxonomically and functionally coherent structure. The level of structural redundancy may therefore be an indirect measure of the resilience or compensation potential within an assemblage.},

   abstract = {A new tool combining the use of HPLC pigment markers with ecological similarity indices, to provide a fast and effective environmental tool for monitoring water quality, was investigated. HPLC pigment concentrations from a 4-year time series data set (2000-2003) from the western English Channel were used to calculate six similarity indices to assess changes in phytoplankton community structure. Indices obtained from HPLC data were compared with those produced from the corresponding phytoplankton biomass derived from microscopic analysis. Multivariate RELATE analyses (P<0.001) suggested that there was little loss of information when species biomass data were grouped into higher taxonomic levels, thereby providing justification for the use of pigment markers. To test the proposed methodology, product moment (r) and Spearman's rank (r(s)) correlation analyses were performed. Highly significant correlations (P<0.01, Canberra Metric: P<0.05) between percentage similarities derived from phytoplankton class biomass and pigment markers were found for all indices when data were pooled (n=104). A Mann-Whitney U-test suggested that indices were more sensitive to changes in relative biomass than pigment concentrations; however, pigment data also produced statistically significant findings (P<0.05). Combining HPLC pigment markers and ecological similarity indices to assess phytoplankton community structure has advantages over microscopy in that it is rapid, reproducible and better suited to large-scale environmental monitoring. We present a basic protocol for implementing this new tool using a suite of similarity indices into environmental monitoring of phytoplankton communities.},

The river plumes are high in N/P ratio in late winter and spring, but not in the inner plume during the summer. Conservative behavior results in most nutrients entering the estuary and eventually reaching the coastal zone. Temporal and spatial aspects of phytoplankton growth and nutrient uptake in the northern Bay of Biscay distinguish the central area of salinity 34 from the plume area. The first diatom bloom appears offshore in late winter, at the edge of the river plumes, taking advantage of haline stratification and anticyclonic “weather windows.” In spring, when the central area of the northern shelf is phosphorus-limited, small cells predominate in the phytoplankton community and compete with bacteria for both mineral and organic phosphorus. At that period, river plumes are less extensive than in winter, but local nutrient enrichment at the river mouth allows diatom growth. In summer, phytoplankton become nitrogen-limited in the river plumes; the central area of the shelf is occupied by small forms of phytoplankton, which are located on the thermocline and use predominantly regenerated nutrients.},

   abstract = {1. Positive effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning have often been demonstrated in 'macrobial' communities. This relation and the responsible mechanisms are far less clear for microbial communities. Most experimental studies on microorganisms have used randomly assembled communities that do not resemble natural communities. It is therefore difficult to predict the consequences of realistic, non-random diversity loss. 2. In this study, we used naturally co-occurring diatom species from intertidal mudflats to assemble communities with realistically decreasing diversity and analysed the effect of non-random species loss on biomass production. 3. Our results demonstrate a highly positive biodiversity effect on production, with mixtures outperforming the most productive component species in more than half of the combinations. These strong positive diversity effects could largely be attributed to positive complementarity effects (including both niche complementarity and facilitation), despite the occurrence of negative selection effects which partly counteracted the positive complementarity effects at higher diversities. 4. Facilitative interactions were, at least in part, responsible for the higher biomass production. For one of the species, Cylindrotheca closterium, we show its ability to significantly increase its biomass production in response to substances leaked into the culture medium by other diatom species. In these conditions, the species drastically reduced its pigment concentration, which is typical for mixotrophic growth. 5. Synthesis. We show that both species richness and identity have strong effects on the biomass production of benthic diatom biofilms and that transgressive overyielding is common in these communities. In addition, we show mechanistic evidence for facilitation which is partly responsible for enhanced production. Understanding the mechanisms by which diversity enhances the performance of ecosystems is crucial for predicting the consequences of species loss for ecosystem functioning. },

The Tagus estuary is one of the most contaminated by mercury derived from the outfalls of a chloralkali plant and from other industrial sources. In deposited sediments the median level, 1·0 μg Hg g−1, is twenty times higher than the natural background and Hg contents depend on the sediment grain-size, age and the distance from waste-outfalls. Suspended matter is more regularly and highly contaminated (median value: 4·5 μg Hg g−1). In the French estuaries Hg levels in the suspended material decrease with salinity due to dilution and/or remobilization processes. In June 1982, in the Loire estuary, high values of Hg are observed in the middle estuary and attributed to urban and industrial sources. In the Tagus estuary, the general distribution of total dissolved Hg confirms the contamination: it increases seaward from 10 ng 1−1 in the river to 80 ng 1−1 in the estuary outlet. The dissolved Hg is almost totally organic in the river, inorganic in the middle estuary due to inorganic Hg effluents and again organic in the lower estuary. This variation is related to the dissolved organic carbon values. The dissolved Hg levels in the Loire Estuary (5–300 ng 1−1) are much higher than in the Gironde estuary (3–6 ng 1−1) and of the same order as those observed in the Tagus estuary.},

   abstract = {Shallow, saline inland lakes occur over large areas in Central-Europe and they bear exceptionally high biological conservation values. Climate change and anthropogenic activities threaten their natural conditions, or even their existence. These aquatic ecosystems are exposed to multiple stress like naturally high conductivity, pH and nutrient load with very low transparency for light. As they are subjects of criteria set by the EC Water Framework Directive and biological conservation managment, there is an urgent need for developing a suitable quality index for their ecological status assessment. As one major Biological Quality Element, benthic diatoms may provide a reliable basis for their ecological status indication. Here, in a large data set covering the soda lakes of the Carpathian basin, we developed a species- and a trait-based diatom ecological status index. First, based on the weighted average method, we developed a type specific, species-based diatom index (DISP = Diatom Index for Soda Pans) using conductivity as master variable of environmental constrains; and therefore the ecological status in soda lakes. Furthermore, by adapting and improving further the widely-used diatom ecological guild concept, we also developed an alternative trait-based index, which helps avoiding some limitations arising from the obvious complexity of the taxonomy-based approach. Our DISP index covered a significantly larger species pool for index calculation, and responded to conductivity in a more reliable way compared to other available indices. In the trait-based index (TBI) motility, small cell size, and less roundish, more elongated shape as functional and morphological traits indicated pristine ecological conditions (i.e high conductivity) of the soda pans. Planktic life form, high and low ecological guild profiles, as well as the large cell size indicated worse ecological conditions (e.g. lower conductivity). Our study highlights that benthic diatoms provide a reliable basis for ecological status assessment in soda lakes. While both the taxonomic and the functional trait approaches performed well in our analysis, the success of the trait-based approach may enable the use of our TBI index in biomonitoring and conservation management of soda lakes outside of the Carpathian basin, independently of the geographic location.},

   abstract = {Information on the distribution of microphytobenthos (micro-algae forming biofilms on sediment surfaces) and phytoplankton in the Severn estuary is reviewed. Microphytobenthos (MPB) are widely distributed in salt marsh and mudflat environments, with biomass levels lower than in other estuaries (average 53 mg chl am(-2) on mud, 12 mg chl am(-2) on sand). Seasonal and spatial patterns occur in the species composition of biofilms. Large areas of the Severn have not been surveyed, but it is likely that MPB are abundant in these regions. Dissolved inorganic N, P and Si concentrations are high in the upper estuary (>400 microM nitrate, >10 microM phosphate, >140 microM silicate) and decrease seaward. Phytoplanktonic chl a concentrations are low in the main estuary (2.2 microg chl aL(-1)), but increase in the Bristol Channel and at the head of the estuary (>10 microg chl aL(-1)). High turbidity is the likely cause for low phytoplankton activity. Annual production of MPB was estimated at 33 g Cm(-2) of inter-tidal area y(-1) in the Severn estuary. This estimated benthic primary production would utilise 3.9% and 4.9% of the annual estuarine N and P loads. Construction of tidal energy barrages is estimated to significantly reduce annual estuarine MPB production (by 77% for the Cardiff-Weston barrage). It is unlikely that any potential increases in MPB biomass on remaining inter-tidal areas will be sufficient to compensate for these losses. In general, the data coverage for benthic and planktonic distribution, production and related nutrient cycles is extremely limited and significant new research work is needed to enable more definite predictions of the post-barrage situation to be made.},

   abstract = {Successional patterns are dependent on the nature of the substratum, water flow, concentrations of organics as well as the availability of bacteria, algal spores and invertebrate larvae in the coastal environment. Bacteria play an especially important role in biofilm formation as they are generally the earliest colonizers. In the present study, both winter and summer biofilm succession patterns were examined on glass coverslips inverted on experimental racks attached at two tidal levels on a sheltered shore in Hong Kong. In the succession, bacteria were followed by diatoms and cyanobacteria. Encrusting algae appeared in the late stages of the experiment (day 80 in summer and day 60 in winter). Colonization by bacteria was much slower in summer and their density remained low throughout the experimental period. The first appearance of diatoms and cyanobacteria, however, was more rapid in the summer. Bacteria and diatoms on the low-shore surfaces also had a faster succession rate than on the high-shore surfaces, suggesting that desiccation/aerial temperature are the causal factors for such differences.},

DNA amplification by real-time PCR, based on diatom-specific oligonucleotide primers designed on small-subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA), was performed in addition to diatom conventional cell counting and spectrophotometric determination of photo-pigments. Moreover, cations and anions were determined in sediments with the aim to identify factors involved in the control of diatom abundance. Diatom distribution was found quite heterogeneous displaying significant differences from site to site. The salinity in sediments ranged from 45.1 at Gerlache inlet to 76.2 at Penguin Bay and it was correlated with cell abundance, biodiversity, amount of pigments and amplified DNA. The dominant species, Fragilariopsis curta, was associated to sediment salinity brines.},

   abstract = {In aquatic habitats, micro-organisms successfully adhere to and mediate particles, thus changing the erosive response of fine sediments to hydrodynamic forcing by secreting glue-like extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Because sediment dynamics is vital for many ecological and economic aspects of watersheds and coastal regions, biostabilization of cohesive sediments is one of the important ecosystem services provided by biofilms. Although the research on biostabilization has gained momentum over the last 20 years, we still have limited insights principally due to the complex nature of this topic, the varying spatial, temporal, and community scales examined, oversimplified ecohydraulic experiments with little natural relevance, and the often partial views of the disciplines involved. This review highlights the current state of our knowledge on biostabilization and identifies important areas for future research on: (A) the influence of abiotic conditions on initial colonization and subsequent biofilm growth, focusing on hydrodynamics, substratum, salinity, nutrition, and light climate; (B) the response of microbes in terms of physiological activity and species diversity to environmental settings as well as biotic conditions such as competition and grazing; and (C) the effects of the former on the EPS matrix, its main constituents, their composition, functional groups/substitutes, and structures/linkages. The review focuses specifically on how the numerous mutual feedback mechanisms between abiotic and biotic conditions influence microbial stabilization capacity, and thus cohesive sediment dynamics.},

In this review we analyze scaling relationships related to energy acquisition and transformation and power-laws related to fluctuations in numbers. Our aim is to show how individual level attributes can help to explain and predict patterns at the level of populations that can propagate at upper levels of organization. We review similar relationships also appearing in the analysis of aquatic ecosystems (i.e. the biomass spectra) in the context of ecological invariant relationships (i.e. independent of size) such as the 'energetic equivalence rule' and the 'linear biomass hypothesis'. We also discuss some power-law distributions emerging in the analysis of numbers and fluctuations in ecological attributes as they point to regularities that are yet to be integrated with traditional scaling relationships and which we foresee as an exciting area of future research.},

Some of them, notably of the genus Cocconeis are found in characteristically shaped cavities which are interpreted as made by the diatoms themselves. The occurrence of the borings indicates that epipsammic diatoms can play a role in the weathering process of calcareous substrates.},

   abstract = {Although surveys of soft-bottom macrofauna are an important tool in marine pollution monitoring, the high costs involved have often been criticised. Species identification is time-consuming, and one solution is to identify organisms to a taxonomic level higher than species. This study, using data from a survey in the vicinity of the Valhall oil field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, examines the effects of using abundances of different taxonomic levels, and of using different data transformations (used to adjust the relative weightings of rare and abundant taxa) in subsequent multivariate analyses of faunal patterns, and relates the environmental variables to the observed faunal patterns from the different analyses. The study area has a constant water depth, homogeneous bottom sediment and a uniform benthic community. At the time of the survey the platform had been active for 9 yr, and strong gradients in environmental contaminants and related faunal changes were found. Data from 27 stations around the oil platform were analysed at the levels of species, genus, family, order, class and phylum, using a range of data transformations and multivariate techniques. The data matrix contained 156 species grouped into 138 genera, 102 families, 42 orders, 18 classes and 10 phyla. Matrices derived from species, genus and family abundances constructed using the same transformation are very similar, and even at higher taxonomic levels the gradient of change in community structure is still detectable. As the taxonomic level increases the effects of transformations become stronger, so although both taxonomic resolution and transformation affect the results of analyses, the effects of each are different and, to a large extent, unrelated. The highest correlations between matrices derived from measured environmental variables and biotic matrices are between environmental variables related to drilling activity and mildly transformed family abundances, suggesting that analyses of higher taxonomic levels are more likely to reflect a contamination gradient than are analyses based on species abundances. Before any general recommendations regarding taxonomic levels are given for future macrobenthic surveys, there is an obvious need for studies of weak, intermediate and strong gradients in various types of contamination in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, using the same sampling and analysis methods.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the effects of anthropogenically-driven changes in global temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide and biodiversity on the functionality of marine ecosystems is crucial for predicting and managing the associated impacts. Coastal ecosystems are important sources of carbon (primary production) to shelf waters and play a vital role in global nutrient cycling. These systems are especially vulnerable to the effects of human activities and will be the first areas impacted by rising sea levels. Within these coastal ecosystems, microalgal assemblages (microphytobenthos: MPB) are vital for autochthonous carbon fixation. The level of in situ production by MPB mediates the net carbon cycling of transitional ecosystems between net heterotrophic or autotrophic metabolism. In this study, we examine the interactive effects of elevated atmospheric CO(2) concentrations (370, 600, and 1000 ppmv), temperature (6 degrees C, 12 degrees C, and 18 degrees C) and invertebrate biodiversity on MPB biomass in experimental systems. We assembled communities of three common grazing invertebrates (Hydrobia ulvae, Corophium volutator and Hediste diversicolor) in monoculture and in all possible multispecies combinations. This experimental design specifically addresses interactions between the selected climate change variables and any ecological consequences caused by changes in species composition or richness. RESULTS: The effects of elevated CO(2) concentration, temperature and invertebrate diversity were not additive, rather they interacted to determine MPB biomass, and overall this effect was negative. Diversity effects were underpinned by strong species composition effects, illustrating the importance of individual species identity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that in natural systems, the complex interactions between changing environmental conditions and any associated changes in invertebrate assemblage structure are likely to reduce MPB biomass. Furthermore, these effects would be sufficient to affect the net metabolic balance of the coastal ecosystem, with important implications for system ecology and sustainable exploitation.},

Mechanics of the nucleus may also be involved in determining which genes are expressed in a given cell. There are two major approaches at present to the mechanics of differentiation in embryos: morphomechanics and differentiation waves. These are compared in detail, to provide a starting point for future experimental work to bring them into one conceptual framework. This may rationalize the present cookbookery of stem cell production by placing it in the context of differentiation waves and the differentiation code. Embryonics, the realization of concepts from embryology in computer hardware and software, might be considerably enhanced by incorporating mechanical concepts of embryogenesis. Segmented robots, modular robotics, cellular microrobotics, flexible electronics, wearable computers, diatom nanotechnology and waves in active media point to a synthesis that we could call embryonic robotics.},

Chlorophyll a, HPLC pigment composition, flow cytometrically-determined picoplankton concentration, taxonomic composition of phytoplankton (based on optical microscopy) and genetic fingerprint patterns of 16S (cyanobacteria- and chloroplast-specific primers) and 18S rRNA genes were determined for samples from ponds with salinities ranging from 4% to 37%. Both morphological and genetical descriptors of taxonomic composition showed a good agreement and indicated a major discontinuity at salinities between 15% and 22%. The number of classes and the Shannon diversity index corresponding to the different descriptors showed a consistent decreasing trend with increasing salinity. The results indicate a selective effect of extremely high salinities on phytoplanktonic assemblages.},

   abstract = {In spring 2005, monthly sampling was carried out at a sublittoral site near Tautra Island. Microphytobenthic identification, abundance (ABU), and biomass (BIOM), were performed by microscopic analyses. Bacillariophyceae accounted for 67% of the total ABU, and phytoflagellates constituted 30%. The diatom floristic list consisted of 38 genera and 94 species. Intact light-harvesting pigments chl a, chl c, and fucoxanthin and their derivatives were identified and quantified by HPLC. Photoprotective carotenoids were also observed (only as diadinoxanthin; no diatoxanthin was detected). Average fucoxanthin content was 4.57 ± 0.45 μg fucoxanthin · g sediment dry mass−1, while the mean chl a concentration was 2.48 ± 0.15 μg · g−1 dry mass. Both the high fucoxanthin:chl a ratio (considering nondegraded forms) and low amounts of photoprotective carotenoids indicated that the benthic microalgal community was adapted to low light. Microphytobenthic primary production was estimated in situ (MPPs, from 0.15 to 1.28 mg C · m−2 · h−1) and in the laboratory (MPPp, from 6.79 to 34.70 mg C · m−2 · h−1 under light saturation) as 14C assimilation; in April it was additionally estimated from O2-microelectrode studies (MPPO2) along with the community respiration. MPPO2 and the community respiration equaled 22.9 ± 7.0 and 7.4 ± 1.8 mg C · m−2 · h−1, respectively. A doubling of BIOM from April to June in parallel with a decreasing photosynthetic activity per unit chl a led us to suggest that the microphytobenthic community was sustained by heterotrophic metabolism during this period. },

   abstract = {Freshwater diatoms are considered to be reliable indicators of the trophic status of rivers and lakes. In the past 30 years, a number of indicator indices have been developed and used for the assessment of trophic conditions all over Europe. It is however still not clear whether the ecologic signature of diatoms differs between these indicator indices. The present study assessed a large number of published European indices on the response of freshwater diatoms to trophic conditions by evaluating the consistency in the use of taxa and their trophic score from seven European indicator indices. The STAR (Standardisations of River Classifications) diatom database, a large set of samples from European running waters, was used to test the application of trophic classifications in water quality assessment. The analysis of taxa in common within the trophic indices showed that there are considerable differences between the indices, for example in the score of trophic values. There was more agreement in classification of taxa within the oligotrophic and the hypertrophic preferences than within the mesotrophic range. Based on these results, a list of diatom taxa, that are consistently used in different trophic indices, was composed. It included 159 ‘reliable’ taxa that are not sensitive to regional setting, water type and taxonomic uncertainty. The list was further accompanied by a description of the taxa's trophic preferences. The large deviation in trophic scores for a number of diatom taxa could most probably be explained by taxonomic uncertainties. Application of these taxa for trophic assessment was questionable. The test set of the 359 STAR samples showed that differences between the trophic indices also lead to a significant variation in the water quality assessment results. Although trophic indices provide an excellent biomonitoring tool, they should be applied with caution, considering the recommendations provided in this paper.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple method to find indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical significance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to Twinspan, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies. The new method identifies indicator species for typologies of species relevés obtained by any hierarchical or nonhierarchical classification procedure; its use is independent of the classification method. Because indicator species give ecological meaning to groups of sites, this method provides criteria to compare typologies, to identify where to stop dividing clusters into subsets, and to point out the main levels in a hierarchical classification of sites. Species can be grouped on the basis of their indicator values for each clustering level, the heterogeneous nature of species assemblages observed in any one site being well preserved. Such assemblages are usually a mixture of eurytopic (higher level) and stenotopic species (characteristic of lower level clusters). The species assemblage approach demonstrates the importance of the “sampled patch size,” i.e., the diversity of sampled ecological combinations, when we compare the frequencies of core and satellite species. A new way to present species–site tables, accounting for the hierarchical relationships among species, is proposed. A large data set of carabid beetle distributions in open habitats of Belgium is used as a case study to illustrate the new method.},

Despite the ecological importance of bacteria, past practical and theoretical constraints have limited our ability to document patterns of bacterial diversity and to understand the processes that determine these patterns. However, recent advances in molecular techniques that allow more thorough detection of bacteria in nature have made it possible to examine such patterns and processes. Here, we review recent studies of the distribution of free-living bacterial diversity and compare our current understanding with what is known about patterns in plant and animal diversity. From these recent studies a preliminary picture is emerging: bacterial diversity may exhibit regular patterns, and in some cases these patterns may be qualitatively similar to those observed for plants and animals.},

   abstract = {The amphipod, Echinogammarus marinus, is common in sheltered coastal inlets, such as estuaries and sea lochs, in Scotland and exhibits increased levels of intersex in some contaminated areas. Sea lochs are commonly the location for coastal aquaculture development, and some chemicals used in fish-farming are specifically designed to target the crustacean nervous system. Therefore it was hypothesised that these chemicals may also affect neuro-endocrine pathways, causing morphological and reproductive abnormalities in non-target Crustacea. Based upon this hypothesis, Echinogammarus marinus amphipods from two different Scottish sea lochs containing salmon farms were investigated. Morphology, intersexuality, and the incidence of microsporidian parasites were recorded at sites close and at distance from fish-farms. Results suggest a higher incidence of intersexuality at sites within sea lochs, comparable to that observed in industrially contaminated sites elsewhere in Scotland. The data suggest that fish farming activity may influence the observed distributions of intersexuality within lochs. Intersex specimens were more likely to be infected by microsporidian parasites than non-intersex specimens. Normal females were found more likely to be infected by microsporidian parasites at sites associated with high intersexuality, suggesting the parasite as the probable feminiser. The cause(s) for the observed patterns of intersexuality are unclear, although suggestions relating to discharges from fish farms are discussed.},

   abstract = {The objective of the present study was to estimate in vivo pigment composition and to retrieve absorption cross-section values, a( *), of photosynthetic micro-organisms using a non-invasive technique of reflectance spectrometry. To test the methodology, organisms from different taxonomical groups and different pigment composition were used (Spirulina platensis a Cyanophyta, Porphyridium cruentum a Rhodophyta, Dunaliella tertiolecta a Chlorophyta and Entomoneis paludosa a Bacillariophyta) and photoacclimated to two different irradiance levels: 25 mumol photonm(-2)s(-1) (Low Light, LL) and 500 mumol photonm(-2)s(-1) (High Light, HL). Second derivative spectra from reflectance were used to identify pigment in vivo absorption bands that were linked to specific pigments detected by high performance liquid chromatography. Whereas some absorption bands such as those induced by Chlorophyll (Chl) a (416, 440, 625 and around 675 nm) were ubiquous, others were taxonomically specific (e.g. 636 nm for Chl c in E. paludosa) and/or photo-physiological dependent (e.g. 489 nm for zeaxanthin in the HL-acclimated S. platensis). The optical absorption cross-section, a( *), was retrieved from reflectance data using a radiative transfer model previously developed for microphytobenthos. Despite the cellular Chl a decrease observed from LL to HL (up to 88% for S. platensis), the a( *) increased, except for P. cruentum. This was attributed to a 'package effect' and to a greater absorption by photoprotective carotenoids that did not contribute to the energy transfer to the core Chl a.},

   abstract = {1. A fundamental question in ecology is which factors determine species richness. Here, we studied the relative importance of regional species pool and local environmental characteristics in determining local species richness (LSR). Typically, this question has been studied using whole communities or a certain taxonomic group, although including species with widely varying biological traits in the same analysis may hinder the detection of ecologically meaningful patterns. 2. We studied the question above for whole stream macroinvertebrate community and within functional feeding guilds. We defined the local scale as a riffle site and the regional scale (i.e. representing the regional species pool) as a stream. Such intermediate-sized regional scale is rarely studied in this context. 3. We sampled altogether 100 sites, ten riffles (local scale) in each of ten streams (regional scale). We used the local-regional richness regression plots to study the overall effect of regional species pool on LSR. Variation partitioning was used to determine the relative importance of regional species pool and local environmental conditions for species richness. 4. The local-regional richness relationship was mainly linear, suggesting strong species pool effects. Only one guild showed some signs of curvilinearity. However, variation partitioning showed that local environmental characteristics accounted for a larger fraction of variance in LSR than regional species pool. Also, the relative importance of the fractions differed between the whole community and guilds, as well as among guilds. 5. This study indicates that the importance of the local and regional processes may vary depending on feeding guild and trophic level. We conclude that both the size of the regional species pool and local habitat characteristics are important in determining LSR of stream macroinvertebrates. Our results are in agreement with recent large-scale studies conducted in highly different study systems and complement the previous findings by showing that the interplay of regional and local factors is also important at intermediate regional scales.},

   abstract = {The increase in extreme events such as storms is one of the major threats that coastal ecosystems will have to face in the near future. In such a context, both maturation and ecological successions processes remain at the core of ecology to better anticipate the changes to ecosystem biodiversity and functions facing environmental stressors. However, these concepts are mainly approached through closed experimental studies that oversimplify the mechanisms. A survey was carried out on a ‘natural’ and open ecosystem subjected to an acute disturbance, i.e. a marine submersion of freshwater drained marshes, occurring after a storm. Plankton biomass, production and taxonomic/functional phytoplankton diversity were followed weekly at four stations over 2 months. Most of the stations were disrupted by this acute disturbance and displayed gradual growth and development, as described in the classical maturation process. The main differences between stations were attributed to the heterogeneity of the communities before the storm, the intensity of the disturbance and the different human actions performed to recover the freshwater environment. The concept of ‘ecological resilience’ was thus better suited than ‘engineering resilience’ for such open systems facing constant fluctuations in environmental drivers. With regard to ecological succession, the more impacted stations were marked by a significant change in taxonomic beta-diversity, with numerous stochastic processes, due to taxa dispersion. They first exhibited a convergence in functional traits due to the increase in nutrient availability drained from the catchment basin and then an increase in divergence when nutrients became limited.},

   abstract = {An investigation of the impacts from elevated intertidal Pacific oyster culture in a New Zealand estuary showed enhanced sedimentation beneath culture racks compared with other sites. Seabed elevation beneath racks was generally lower than between them, suggesting that topographic patterns more likely result from a local effect of rack structures on hydrodynamic processes than from enhanced deposition. Compared with control sites, seabed sediments within the farm had a greater silt/clay and organic content, and a lower redox potential and shear strength. While a marked trend in macrofaunal species richness was not evident, species composition and dominance patterns were consistent with a disturbance gradient, with farm effects not evident 35 m from the perimeter of the racks. Of the environmental variables measured, sediment shear strength was most closely associated with the distribution and density of macrofauna, suggesting that human-induced disturbance from farming operations may have contributed to the biological patterns. To evaluate the taxonomic sufficiency needed to document impacts, aggregation to the family level based on Linnean classification was compared with an aggregation scheme based on ;general groups' identifiable with limited taxonomic expertise. Compared with species-level analyses, spatial patterns of impact were equally discernible at both aggregation levels used, provided density rather than presence/absence data were used. Once baseline conditions are established and the efficacy of taxonomic aggregation demonstrated, a ;general group' scheme provides an appropriate and increasingly relevant tool for routine monitoring.},

   abstract = {Many biological data sets, from field observations and manipulative experiments, involve crossed factor designs, analysed in a univariate context by higher-way analyses of variance which partition out ‘main’ and ‘interaction’ effects. Indeed, tests for significance of interactions among factors, such as differing Before–After responses at Control and Impact sites, are the basis of the widely used BACI strategy for detecting impacts in the environment. There are difficulties, however, in generalising simple univariate definitions of interaction, from classic linear models, to the robust, non-parametric multivariate methods that are commonly required in handling assemblage data. The size of an interaction term, and even its existence at all, depends crucially on the measurement scale, so it is fundamentally a parametric construct. Despite this, certain forms of interaction can be examined using non-parametric methods, namely those evidenced by changing assemblage patterns over many time periods, for replicate sites from different experimental conditions (types of ‘Beyond BACI’ design) – or changing multivariate structure over space, at many observed times. Second-stage MDS, which can be thought of as an MDS plot of the pairwise similarities between MDS plots (e.g. of assemblage time trajectories), can be used to illustrate such interactions, and they can be formally tested by second-stage ANOSIM permutation tests. Similarities between (first-stage) multivariate patterns are assessed by rank-based matrix correlations, preserving the fully non-parametric approach common in marine community studies. The method is exemplified using time-series data on corals from Thailand, macrobenthos from Tees Bay, UK, and macroalgae from a complex recolonisation experiment carried out in the Ligurian Sea, Italy. The latter data set is also used to demonstrate how the analysis copes straightforwardly with certain repeated-measures designs.},

   abstract = {Experiments were performed to evaluate short-term changes in sediment extracellular carbohydrates for a multispecific assemblage of benthic diatoms in relation to physiological status, endogenous migratory rhythms, and environmental conditions. For this purpose, a mesocosm was used, which simulated both tidal and dark: light alternating cycles under controlled conditions. Scanning electronic microscopy in combination with picture analyses indicated that natural diatom migration patterns were reproduced in the mesocosm. Two EPS fractions were operationally separated in colloidal carbohydrate measurements: alcohol-soluble EPS (termed "soluble EPS") and alcohol-insoluble EPS (termed "bound EPS"). Microphytobenthic biomass followed a logistic-type curve and converged toward a maximal value termed the "biotic capacity of the local environment." Both EPS fractions showed oscillations with production during photosynthetic periods and sharp decreases during night immersion periods. Productions of both EPS fractions increased with Chl a production during light periods suggesting a light dependence in relation to migratory patterns. The decreases in both EPS fractions, which occurred during night immersion periods suggest that carbohydrate hydrolysis and/or washaway affected both EPS fractions similarly in benthic environments. Our results confirm the theory according to which the two distinct fractions are under different metabolic controls. No change in soluble EPS release was obtained during the transition from logarithmic to stationary phase. On the other hand, a metabolism modification of microalgae, probably related to ammonium depletion, occurred when cells entered the stationary phase, since there was a high enhancement in bound EPS production. Mesocosm results can serve as a system of reference useful to characterize biofilm development in field investigations and to revisit the effective implication of each EPS fraction in sediment stability.},

   abstract = {Benthic diatom communities have been documented many times to exhibit a predictable pattern of migration entrained to diurnal and tidal cycles forming transient biofilms in the estuarine intertidal. The highly visible nature of these biofilms means that many anecdotal descriptions of this behaviour exist, yet much still remains to be elucidated about these behaviours and what drives them. There has been a resurgence in work examining the migratory patterns of benthic diatoms because of the important roles they play in the overall functioning of the ecosystem (e.g. primary production). It is the aim of this paper to provide a comprehensive overview of the migratory literature to date. The paper will review the methodology that was historically used to examine patterns in diatom migration as well as introduce new technologies (e.g. remote sensing). The patterns and cues for migration are discussed, highlighting the fact that whilst a "classic" pattern of migration is often found (migration of cells to the sediment surface as the tide leaves the site followed by a downwards migration in anticipation of the incoming tide), these cannot be considered to be consistent, with many site and taxon specific idiosyncrasies. Furthermore, it has been suggested that cells also migrate within the biofilm, cycling their position at the sediment surface therefore maximising their overall fitness, and this hypothesis is discussed.

   abstract = {Benthic diatom communities are used in the ecological assessment of Portuguese rivers through the calculation of an autecological index, the IPS (Indice de Polluosensibilité Spécifique), officially adopted for Portugal. This index requires a high level of taxonomic expertise for morphological identification of individuals at species level. Advances in genomics, such as the DNA metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing techniques offer a promising alternative to this classical approach, decreasing expertise requirement and therefore reducing time and costs. The aim of this study was to test the potential of DNA metabarcoding of diatoms in the bioassessment of Portuguese rivers, by comparing the classifications of the IPS obtained with morphological and molecular approaches. A total of 88 samples were collected in four river types and a quality gradient in central Portugal in the spring of 2017, following the Water Framework Directive (WFD) standards. The morphological approach comprised taxonomic identification of at least 400 valves, under the light microscope. Molecular approach included eDNA extraction followed by PCR amplification and DNA high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) using a diatom-specific 312 bp rbcL DNA barcode. Sequences were analysed with Mothur software, producing Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that were taxonomically assigned using the R-Syst::diatom reference library. We also tested the effect of a correction factor (CF) based on biovolume for the quantification of molecular data. When comparing the number of species identified, morphological, molecular without and with CF inventories revealed 306, 125 and 111 species, respectively. Molecular data showed 67% of unassigned OTUs. These results were mainly due to the incompleteness of the reference library, which currently represents the major difficulty in taxonomic assignment of DNA sequences in metabarcoding. Regarding IPS values, the results indicated a good correlation between morphological and molecular methods, particularly when applying the CF. Furthermore, Principal Coordinates analysis plot based on species abundances revealed a quality gradient in all 3 methodologies (morphological, molecular without and with CF). These results support the hypothesis that DNA metabarcoding is a valid approach for ecological quality assessment of Portuguese rivers. Yet, there is still work to be done on this new methodology to enable a smooth transition between the traditional and this new approach without misspend accumulated knowledge from the last decades on water quality assessment.},

   abstract = {Diatoms, which are early autotrophic colonisers, are an important constituent of the biofouling community in the marine environment. The effects of substratum and temporal variations on the fouling diatom community structure in a monsoon-influenced tropical estuary were studied. Fibreglass and glass coupons were exposed every month for a period of 4 days and the diatom population sampled at 24 h intervals, over a period of 14 months. The planktonic diatom community structure differed from the biofilm community. Pennate diatoms dominated the biofilms whilst centric diatoms were dominant in the water column. Among the biofilm diatoms, species belonging to the genera Navicula, Amphora, Nitzschia, Pleurosigma and Thalassionema were dominant. On certain occasions, the influence of planktonic blooms was also seen on the biofilm community. A comparative study of biofilms formed on the two substrata revealed significant differences in density and diversity. However species composition was almost constant. In addition to substratum variations, the biofilm diatom community structure also showed significant seasonal variations, which were attributed to physico-chemical and biological changes in both the water and substratum. Temporal variations in the tychopelagic diatoms of the water were also observed to exert an influence on the biofilm diatom community. Variations in diatom communities may determine the functional ecosystem of the benthic environment.},

   abstract = {Salinity imposes a significant barrier to the distribution of many organisms, including diatoms. Diatoms are ancestrally marine, and the number of times they have independently colonized fresh waters and the physiological adaptations that facilitated these transitions remain outstanding questions in diatom evolution. The colonization of fresh waters by diatoms has been compared to "crossing the Rubicon," implying that successful colonization events are rare, irreversible, and lead to substantial species diversification. To test these hypotheses, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Thalassiosirales, a diatom lineage with high diversity in both marine and fresh waters. We collected approximately 5.3kb of DNA sequence data from the nuclear (SSU and partial LSU rDNA) and chloroplast genomes (psbC and rbcL) and reconstructed the phylogeny using parsimony and Bayesian methods. Alternative topology tests strongly reject all previous colonization hypotheses, including monophyly of the predominantly freshwater Stephanodiscaceae. Results showed at least three independent colonizations of fresh waters, and whereas previous accounts of freshwater-to-marine transitions have been discounted, these results provide compelling evidence for as many as three independent re-colonizations of the marine habitat, two of which led to speciation events. This study adds valuable phylogenetic context to previous debate about the nature of the salinity barrier in diatoms and provides compelling evidence that, at least for Thalassiosirales, the salinity barrier might be less formidable than previously thought.},

   abstract = {This study examined trace-element concentrations in 39 sediment samples collected in the vicinity of the abandoned Coval da Mó mine, and evaluated the anthropogenic contaminant effects and other environmental variables in the taxonomic composition, structure and morphological changes of benthic diatom communities. The results show the existence of extremely high contamination in Pb, Zn and Cd (the mean values exceed the background values 376, 96 and 19 times, respectively) on the first 2.5km in the water flow direction. Also Co, Cu, Mn and Ni are present in high concentrations. Dilution by relatively uncontaminated sediment reduces metal concentrations downstream, but Zn concentrations increase downstream Fílvida stream, as a result of several factors such as sewage and agriculture. To evaluate the biological effects caused by Pb, Cd and Zn, three sites were selected. In the stressed environment, near the mining area (C232), diatoms were extremely rare, however there was a slight recovery at site C79 located 2km downstream. Fragilaria capucina var. rumpens, Fragilaria cf. crotonensis and Achnanthidium minutissimum showed abnormal valves which may be related to high levels of metals. Six km downstream, in Fílvida stream (C85), an increase in species richness and diversity was registered while the relative percentage of valve teratologies was lower. In the absence of OM, nutrients and low pH the diatom community patterns must be attributed to the metal concentration at some sites. Considering that community diversity can be affected by abiotic and biotic variables and valve deformations are caused by a small number of variables, basically metals, and acid conditions, we consider the presence of teratologies as an indication of the presence of metals.},

   abstract = {The distribution patterns of seven dominant diatom species on an estuarine mud flat transect were related to salinity gradients and organic pollution. The temporal distribution of species can be explained partly by the seasonal variation in irradiance and temperature, and partly by the large discharges of organically polluted fresh water during the late autumn. The selective effects of stress factors, such as low or high salinity, high concentrations of ammonia and free sulphide, and high temperatures were studied by measuring: (1) the tolerance of natural diatom populations isolated from the sediment; (2) the tolerance and capacities of unialgal cultures: and (3) the effects of the stress factors on the species composition of the populations in sediment samples incubated in the laboratory. A low salinity (1‰), but not a high salinity (20‰), markedly altered the species composition of natural diatom populations kept in the laboratory. Navicula salinarum Grunow and N. cf. cryptocephala Kützing outcompete other species only at a salinity of 1‰, which is below the optimum salinity for growth of these species. High concentrations (2–4 mM) of ammonia inhibited the photosynthesis of N. phyllepta Kützing and N. flanatica Grunow and decreased the cell numbers of these species in mixed populations kept in the laboratory. N. salinarum and Gyrosigma fasciola (Ehr) Cleve were relatively ammonia-tolerant and reached their highest abundance during periods of large discharges of organically polluted water. The populations on the mud-flat stations that had black, sulphide-containing layers 1 mm below the surface of the sediment, were dominated by the relatively sulphide-tolerant Navicula salinarum and N. pygmaea Kützing. High values of irradiance and temperature were a selective factor explaining the absence of N. flanatica in summer. Uptake of organic substrates and the inhibitory effect of high population densities are discussed in regard to their possible modifying influence on the distribution of diatom species on the mud flat.},

   abstract = {Weakly basic fluorescent dyes are used to visualize organelles within live cells due to their affinity to acidic subcellular organelles. In particular, they are used to stain the silica deposited in the silica deposition vesicles (SDVs) of diatoms during the course of their frustule synthesis. This study involved the synthesis of fluorescent dyes derived from oligopropylamines, compounds similar to those found in diatoms. The dyes were obtained by reacting oligopropylamines with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. The reaction was realized using methylated oligopropylamines with two or three nitrogen atoms and yielded two novel fluorescent dyes: NBD-N2 and NBD-N3. The dyes appeared to be highly efficient in the in vivo staining of growing siliceous frustules of diatoms at concentrations at least 10 times lower than those required for staining with HCK-123. NBD-N3 also efficiently stained other subcellular vesicles of eukaryotic unicellular algae. NBD-N2 stained only growing diatom frustules, whereas NBD-N3 also stained various subcellular organelles of different eukaryotic unicellular algae. NBD-N2 and NBD-N3 were not removed from stained diatom frustules by drastic treatments with H(2)SO(4) and H(2)O(2). Fluorescent silica can also be obtained by its chemical precipitation in the presence of NBD-N2 and NBD-N3.},

   abstract = {Biomonitoring is central to the European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD) and to the French water and aquatic environmental law, but most diatom indices do not separate different anthropogenic impacts. To address this gap, the effect of water chemistry on diatom ecological guilds and life forms was assessed in order to indicate stream perturbations. Generalised additive models (GAMs) were built on a large-scale data set of 1571 samples from the French monitoring network. The relationships between diatom ecological guild and life form metrics were investigated by Principal components analysis and the results predicted by GAMs. The models characterised eight chemical parameters that modified adaptive strategies (ecological guilds) and growth morphology (life forms). Total phosphorus, conductivity, nitrate and pH are the main influencing factors, followed by temperature, dissolved oxygen and organic matter. The findings confirm three groups of diatoms with different adaptive strategies: 1 - fast moving species, 2 - species growing close to the substrate and 3 - species extending to the surface layers of the biofilm. Thirteen diatom metrics displayed a variety of responses to different ranges of the eight chemical parameters. These metrics could be used to help to identify and quantify which chemical alterations are caused by polluted effluents in rivers.},

@article{Brehm2003,
   abstract = {Cyanobacteria, algae and bacteria are widespread inhabitants of North Sea microbial mats. Our studies of these populations showed uncommon modes of living and extraordinary structures, which have not been described before. The structures are spherical objects covering a community of cyanobacteria, diatoms and bacteria. The cultivation of these communities in the laboratory and intensive observations of their exceptional movement has led to some spectacular findings. The sphere formations go through different phases with variation in the dominance of different microorganisms. The role of the bacteria is the most important in the first phase, and can be increased by the addition of signal substances. Spheres surrounded by envelopes of unknown composition and permeability appear, with numerous bacteria and sporadic diatoms inside. Then the cyanobacteria penetrate the spheres and arrange themselves at the surface. The communities proliferate over some weeks and are finally released. Laboratory expositions of the microbial communities to different parameters pinpoint the limits of sphere formation. The metabolic products of the sphere communities are concentrated in the spheres and lead to a different kind of compound compared with the surrounding environment. In this way, the microbial communities strongly influence the structure of the sediments. Uncommon circular structures, which develop into spheres between 0.08 and 3 mm in size were found in subcultures of non-axenic filamentous cyanobacteria enrichments from North Sea microbial mats. These filamentous cyanobacteria ( Phormidium sp.) together with associated benthic diatoms of the genus Navicula and associated heterotrophic bacteria were held as reproducible synergistic cultures. Phormidium sp. filaments tightly intertwined with each other, formed the surface of the spheres, trapping diatoms inside. The formation of "spheres" was the result of radial and synchronous movements of the cyanobacteria. In old cultures, the direction of the cyanobacterial movement has turned in the opposite direction, away from the sphere. The integrity of large "spheres" was influenced by chemotactic phenomena and maintained by some type of trichome-trichome interaction. This suggests the presence of metabolic secondary products, which attract cyanobacteria and influence their movement in a form of chemotactic response.},

The abundance of the algae, expressed as cover values, appeared to be influenced by the characteristics of the substrate, especially the ephemeral status and growth rate of the leaves. Colonization of the seagrass leaves occurred primarily on tips and edges, subsequently spreading over the faces to the base. The pioneers appeared to be the dominant, persistent taxa, of which Audouinella virgatula (Harv.) Dixon, Fosliella lejolisii (Rosan.) Howe, Myrionema magnusii (Sauv.) Lois. and the diatoms were most prominent. The oldest parts of fully grown leaves showed the most diverse epiphytic vegetation. Though there was a form of succession, a climax community was not reached. On examining the spatial distribution of the epiphytes, a group of characteristic taxa was seen to be accompanied by a second group, whose variation in occurrence seemed to be correlated with the height in the littoral.},

   abstract = {Guanabara Bay (GB) is considered to be one of the most polluted environments of the southern Brazilian coastline. This typical estuarine system is impacted by the heavy discharge of both industrial and domestic waste from the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area. The mollusc community structure and distribution was investigated between 2000 and 2001, using a three month sampling design of 38 stations, according to austral seasons. Species abundance was aggregated into progressively higher taxa matrices (genus, family, order) and were analysed using multivariate techniques. Mollusc distribution in GB varied significantly in space and time and was probably ruled by the organic enrichment effects of hypoxia and altered redox conditions coupled with prevailing patterns of circulation. Within the sectors of GB an increasing gradient in mollusc diversity and occurrence was observed, ranging from the azoic and impoverished stations in the inner sector to a well-structured community in terms of species composition and abundance inhabiting the outer sector. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and cluster analysis showed similar results when species were aggregated into genera and families, while greater difference occurred at coarser taxonomic identification (order). The literature about taxonomic sufficiency has demonstrated that faunal patterns at different taxonomic levels tend to become similar with increased pollution. In Guanabara Bay, an analysis carried out solely at family level is perfectly adequate to describe the ecophysiological stress. Further aggregation to order level changed the perceived patterns of differences. However, a different taxonomic resolution can be chosen depending on the type of ecological patterns investigated.},

The species discussed here are important from the ecological point of view since they are often dominant in benthic freshwater communities.

We examined the original material of Navicula aggerica E. REICHARDT, Navicula atomoides GRUNOW, N. crassulexigua E. REICHARDT, N. minima GRUNOW, N. minima var. typica R. ROSS, N. minutissima (KUTZ.)

Several of these names were regarded as synonyms in many floristic works and, as such, remained forgotten or ignored. Analyses using light and scanning electron microscopy indicate conspecificity of Navicula minima (= Sellaphora seminulum sensu auct. nonnull.) with Sellaphora saugerresii (DESM.) C.E. WETZEL et D.G.

Diatoms have enormous ecological importance on this planet and display a diversity of patterns and structures at the nano- to millimetre scale. Diatom nanotechnology, a new interdisciplinary area, has spawned collaborations in biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, physics, chemistry, material science and engineering. We survey diatom nanotechnology since 2005, emphasizing recent advances in diatom biomineralization, biophotonics, photoluminescence, microfluidics, compustat domestication, multiscale porosity, silica sequestering of proteins, detection of trace gases, controlled drug delivery and computer design. Diatoms might become the first organisms for which the gap in our knowledge of the relationship between genotype and phenotype is closed.},

@article{Pardo2012,
   abstract = {One objective of the European Union (EU)'s Water Framework Directive (WFD: Directive 2000/60/EC) is for all European surface waters to achieve 'good status' by 2015. In support of this objective, the EU has facilitated an intercalibration exercise to ensure harmonized definitions of the status of water bodies, reflecting the deviation of their properties (mainly biotic assemblages) from a minimally disturbed state, termed the "reference condition". One of the major challenges of the WFD has been to find common approaches for defining reference conditions and to define the level of anthropogenic intervention allowed in reference sites. In this paper we describe how river reference sites were selected in the Central-Baltic region of Europe. A list of pressure criteria was provided and 14 Member States (MSs) categorized each criterion according to the method (i.e. measured, field inspection, etc.) used for reference site screening. Additionally, reference land-use and water-chemistry thresholds were agreed among countries in order to base reference site selection on objective criteria. For land-use criteria, a reference threshold and a rejection threshold were established. Sites with all criteria below the reference threshold were considered to be reference sites; sites having most criteria below the reference threshold and only some parameters between the reference and rejection threshold were "possible reference sites". These sites were retained only after carefully checking the cumulative effects of the pressures using local expertise, and a posteriori water-chemistry evaluation was necessary. In general, the most widespread method for defining a reference site was the measurement of pressures, followed by field inspections and expert judgment. However, some major pressures (e.g. hydromorphological alteration) were evaluated in a number of different ways (e.g. measured, field inspection, expert judgment). Our meta-analyses reveal a need to reinforce standardization in the application of pressure criteria by Member States. The pressure criteria identified in this exercise should be refined and tested with biological data to help in the further validation of minimally disturbed sites (i.e. the WFD "reference condition") and to provide a firm foundation for ecological status assessment. This in turn would ensure that there is pan-European comparability when evaluating the achievement of environmental objectives.},

We find that this hiatus in warming coincides with a period of little increase in the sum of anthropogenic and natural forcings. Declining solar insolation as part of a normal eleven-year cycle, and a cyclical change from an El Nino to a La Nina dominate our measure of anthropogenic effects because rapid growth in short-lived sulfur emissions partially offsets rising greenhouse gas concentrations. As such, we find that recent global temperature records are consistent with the existing understanding of the relationship among global surface temperature, internal variability, and radiative forcing, which includes anthropogenic factors with well known warming and cooling effects.},

Diatoms dominated the microphytobenthos community at all sites while coccoid green algae, flagellates or cyanobacteria never contributed significantly to total cell abundance. Epipelic and epipsammic diatoms were the dominant organisms at the brackish sites and disappeared in the oligohaline and freshwater sites, where planktonic diatoms dominated the microphytobenthos community. In oligohaline to freshwater tidal reaches, a turbidity maximum is present which is maintained by repeated resuspension and sedimentation of suspended matter from and to the intertidal areas. Probably, this intense reworking of the sediment surface prevents epipelic and epipsammic diatoms from colonising intertidal mudflats in this part of the estuary.]},

Altogether, 80 infaunal samples (Van-veen grab 0.1 m(2)) were collected which revealed the occurrence of 132 species representing five diverse groups. Polychaetes were the dominant group (45%), followed by bivalves (31%) and gastropods (16%). Diversity (H'log2) was maximum (4.601) at Parangipettai 25 m during the pre-monsoon season, and the minimum (0.954) was in SIPCOT during monsoon. Multivariate analyses were used to define assemblages.},

@book{Sullivan2002,
   abstract = {Benthic microalgae are a ubiquitous feature in sediments directly exposed to full sunlight or shaded by a vascular plant canopy in coastal salt marshes. Diatoms, cyanobacteria, and green algae are the dominant groups. Of these, diatoms are universally present and abundant, exhibit migratory rhythms driven mainly by light, and are by far the taxonomically most diverse group. Dense mats of cyanobacteria and secondarily green algae frequently develop where light levels are high. The more abundant species of all three algal groups are widely distributed within and among salt marshes of the United States and Europe. Standing crops of benthic microalgae beneath various vascular plant canopies exhibit mean annual values of 60 to 160 mg chl a m−2. Annual benthic microalgal production (BMP) has been shown to range from 28 g C m−2 y−1 beneath Juncus roemerianus to 314 g C m−2 y−1 beneath Jaumea carnosa. In general, BMP increases in a southerly direction in Atlantic coast marshes but is lowest in Gulf Coast marshes. In Atlantic and southern California marshes a significant portion of benthic microalgal production occurs when the overstory vascular plants are dormant. Experimental manipulations have shown that BMP and biomass beneath Spartina alterniflora are limited by nitrogen supplies and grazing activities. Manipulation of light appears to primarily affect the relative dominance of diatoms and cyanobacteria in the benthic microalgal assemblage. The ratio of annual BMP to net aerial production of the overstory vascular plant canopy is 10 to 60% in Atlantic and Gulf Coast marshes and 75 to 140% in a southern California marsh. The benthic microalgal portion of this two component productivity system has been shown by multiple stable isotope studies to be a major component of salt marsh food webs. Diatoms, in particular, are the preferred food item of a diverse array of invertebrate and fish species.},

   abstract = {The oceanographic conditions in the north Pacific have shifted to a colder period, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) biomass has declined precipitously in the California Current, the international sardine fishery is collapsing, and mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus and Scomber japonicus) are thriving. This situation occurred in the mid-1900s, but indices of current oceanographic conditions and the results of our acoustic-trawl surveys indicate it likely is recurring now, perhaps with similar socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Also alarming is the repetition of the fishery's response to a declining sardine stock-progressively higher exploitation rates targeting the oldest, largest, and most fecund fish. Furthermore, our data indicate the recent reproductive condition of sardine is poor, and their productivity is below modeled estimates used to derive the current fishery-exploitation rates. Consequently, the sardine population has been reduced to two cohorts that are unlikely to produce an appreciable new cohort. Thus, a near-term recovery of this important stock is unlikely, depending on the return of warmer oceanographic conditions, reduced pressure from mackerel species, and perhaps the adoption of a more precautionary strategy for managing the residual sardine population.},

   abstract = {Chlorophyll pigment and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations were measured in two well-differentiated areas in the Gironde Estuary. The maximum turbidity zone (MTZ) was characterized by very high turbidities, low Chla/SPM ratios and associated low variability of this ratio, and by a highly significant relationship between chlorophyll pigments (chlorophyllaand phaeopigments) and SPM. Seaward of the MTZ, where SPM concentration is lower, the relationship between Chlaand SPM disappeared during phytoplanktonic blooms, the values of Chla/SPM ratio were higher and there was a high variability of this ratio. Data obtained from stations positioned along the salinity gradient indicate that the spatial distribution of Chla/SPM ratio in the Gironde is explained by the relation between the mixing depth (Zm) and euphotic depth (Zeu). The estimate of the Zm/Zeu ratio suggests that there is virtually no possibility for phytoplankton primary production in the MTZ but cannot explain the presence of Chlain very highly turbid areas (>1 g l−1). An important percentage of the chlorophyll in the MTZ probably originates from re-suspended microphytobenthos. Photosynthetic activity is reduced as a consequence of light limitation due to high turbidities. This enables the ecosystem to contain a great input of nutrients without eutrophication.},

@article{Clarke2006,
   abstract = {Bray–Curtis similarity is widely employed in multivariate analysis of assemblage data, for sound biological reasons. This paper discusses two problems, however, with its practical application: its behaviour is erratic (or even undefined) for the vanishingly sparse samples that may be found as an end-point to a severe impact gradient, or a start-point in colonisation studies; and, in common with all similarity measures on species-level data, it is sensitive to inconsistency of taxonomic identification through time. It is shown that the latter problem is ameliorated by application of ‘taxonomic dissimilarity’ coefficients, a natural extension of the concept of taxonomic distinctness indices. Two previous suggestions for use with presence/absence data, denoted here by Γ+ and Θ+, are noted to be simple generalisations of the Bray–Curtis and Kulczynski measures, respectively. Also seen is their ability to permit ordinations of assemblages from wide geographic scales, with no species in common, and for which Bray–Curtis would return zero similarity for all pairs of samples. The primary problem addressed, however, is that of denuded or entirely blank samples. Where it can be convincingly argued that impoverished samples are near-blank from the same cause, rather than by random occurrences from inadequate sample sizes (tow length, core diameter, transect or quadrat size etc.), a simple adjustment to the form of the Bray–Curtis coefficient can generate meaningful MDS displays which would otherwise collapse, and can improve values of the ANOSIM R statistic (increased separation of groups in multivariate space). It is also shown to have no effect at all on the normal functioning of a Bray–Curtis analysis when at least a modest amount of data is present for all samples. Examination of the properties of this ‘zero-adjusted’ Bray–Curtis measure goes hand-in-hand with a wider discussion of the efficacy of competing similarity, distance or dissimilarity coefficients (collectively: resemblance measures) in community ecology. The inherent biological guidelines underlying the ‘Bray–Curtis family’ of measures (including Kulczynski, Sorenson, Ochiai and Canberra dissimilarity) are made explicit. These and other commonly employed measures (e.g. Euclidean, Manhattan, Gower and chi-squared distances) are calculated for several ‘classic’ data sets of impact events or gradients in space and time. Behaviour of particular coefficients is judged against the interpretability of the resulting ordination plots and an objective measure of the ability to discriminate between a priori defined hypotheses, representing impact conditions. A second-stage MDS plot of a set of resemblance coefficients, based on the respective similarities of the multivariate patterns each generates (an MDS of MDS plots, in effect), is seen to be useful in determining which coefficients are extracting essentially different information from the same assemblage matrix. This suggests a mechanism for practical classification of the plethora of resemblance measures defined in the literature. Similarity-based ANOSIM R statistics and Spearman ρ correlations, whose non-parametric structure make them absolutely comparable across different resemblance measures, answer questions about whether the different information extracted by some coefficients is more, or less, helpful to the final biological interpretation.},

   abstract = {Accurate taxonomic resolution in light microscopy analyses of microalgae is essential to achieve high quality, comparable results in both floristic analyses and biomonitoring studies. A number of closely related diatom taxa have been detected to date co-occurring within benthic diatom assemblages, sharing many morphological, morphometrical and ecological characteristics. In this contribution, we analysed the hypothesis that, where a large sample size (number of individuals) is available, common morphometrical parameters (valve length, width and stria density) are sufficient to achieve a correct identification to the species level. We focused on some common diatom taxa belonging to the genus Gomphonema. More than 400 valves and frustules were photographed in valve view and measured using Fiji software. Several statistical tools (mixture and discriminant analysis, k-means clustering, classification trees, etc.) were explored to test whether mere morphometry, independently of other valve features, leads to correct identifications, when compared to identifications made by experts. In view of the results obtained, morphometry-based determination in diatom taxonomy is discouraged.},

   abstract = {Diatoms are significant primary producers in sea ice, an ephemeral habitat with steep vertical gradients of temperature and salinity characterizing the ice matrix environment. To cope with the variable and challenging conditions, sea ice diatoms produce polysaccharide-rich extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that play important roles in adhesion, cell protection, ligand binding and as organic carbon sources. Significant differences in EPS concentrations and chemical composition corresponding to temperature and salinity gradients were present in sea ice from the Weddell Sea and Eastern Antarctic regions of the Southern Ocean. To reconstruct the first metabolic pathway for EPS production in diatoms, we exposed Fragilariopsis cylindrus, a key bi-polar diatom species, to simulated sea ice formation. Transcriptome profiling under varying conditions of EPS production identified a significant number of genes and divergent alleles. Their complex differential expression patterns under simulated sea ice formation was aligned with physiological and biochemical properties of the cells, and with field measurements of sea ice EPS characteristics. Thus, the molecular complexity of the EPS pathway suggests metabolic plasticity in F. cylindrus is required to cope with the challenging conditions of the highly variable and extreme sea ice habitat.},

   abstract = {Contamination in coastal zones is an increasing problem that adversely affects biological diversity and the functioning of coastal ecosystems. Sediment is an important compartment of these zones since large quantities of diverse contaminants can accumulate there. Whole-sediment toxicity assays are of increasing importance, and several assay methods using mainly invertebrates have been developed. However, an important part of the benthic community, the microphytobenthos (represented principally by benthic diatoms and cyanobacteria), has surprisingly been neglected. Recently, comprehensive studies have been conducted using benthic marine microalgae with the object of establishing a toxicity assay method for sediment samples. The main results published to date in the literature and obtained by our own team have been compiled and are discussed in this review. The value and feasibility of using certain organisms of the microphytobenthos group in ecotoxicology studies are also discussed, and a sediment quality guideline based on multivariate procedure has been derived from data obtained in previous studies. Finally, future perspectives for research in this field are discussed.},

   abstract = {The European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD), a new regulation aiming to achieve and maintain a clean and well-managed water environment, refers to phytoplankton as one of the biological quality elements that should be regularly monitored, and upon which the reference conditions of water quality should be established. However, the use of phytoplankton as a biological quality element will result in several constraints, which are analyzed in this article with examples from Portuguese waters. Specifically, the establishment of reference conditions of water quality may be difficult in some water bodies for which no historical data exists. The sampling frequency proposed for phytoplankton monitoring does not seem suitable to assess phytoplankton succession, and may preclude the detection of algal blooms. Finally, the use of chlorophyll a as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass and abundance has been proposed by some authors, but it may overlook blooms of pico- and small nanophytoplankton, and overestimate the importance of large microphytoplankton. Furthermore, most studies in Portugal have used only inverted microscopy for phytoplankton observation and quantification; this method does not permit the distinction between autotrophic and heterotrophic cells, especially in samples preserved with Lugol's solution, and does not allow the observation of smaller-sized cells. Finally, some techniques, such as remote sensing and chemotaxonomic analysis, are proposed to be used as supplements in phytoplankton monitoring programs.},

   abstract = {Changes in elemental concentrations of diatoms and river water from the river Erh-Jen were determined using scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Relatively large amounts of copper and lead found in both planktonic and epilithic diatoms implied these algae might play an important role in biogeochemical cycles and in the transfer of those elements to higher trophic levels in the aquatic environment. Changes in elemental concentrations within diatom cells were found to vary with other elements within cells and the same or different elements in water. Planktonic and epilithic cells showed different correlation patterns. For epilithic diatoms, negative correlations were found between concentrations of total phosphorus and phosphate in water and those of phosphorus within cells, and between concentrations of lead in water and in cells. Concentrations of chromium and mercury within planktonic cells and those of phosphorus, manganese and lead within epilithic ones were found to be easily influenced by other elements in river water, indicating appearance of the competitive manner on uptake of such elements by algal cells. Relatively high concentration factors (CFs) for cadmium, mercury and lead by diatoms in this study suggested they are good accumulators for these heavy metals. Significant negative corrections were found between the CFs of diatoms and the concentrations of elements in river water.},

   abstract = {Numerous taxonomic groups exhibit an evolutionary trajectory in cell or body size. The size structure of marine phytoplankton communities strongly affects food web structure and organic carbon export into the ocean interior, yet macroevolutionary patterns in the size structure of phytoplankton communities have not been previously investigated. We constructed a database of the size of the silica frustule of the dominant fossilized marine planktonic diatom species over the Cenozoic. We found that the minimum and maximum sizes of the diatom frustule have expanded in concert with increasing species diversity. In contrast, the mean area of the diatom frustule is highly correlated with oceanic temperature gradients inferred from the delta18O of foraminiferal calcite, consistent with the hypothesis that climatically induced changes in oceanic mixing have altered nutrient availability in the euphotic zone and driven macroevolutionary shifts in the size of marine pelagic diatoms through the Cenozoic.},

   abstract = {Résumé L'objectif de cette étude est de décrire les caractéristiques biogéographiques des communautés microphytoplanctoniques observées sur le littoral français. Dans un premier temps, l'analyse de la variabilité temporelle à grande échelle géographique permet de décrire le cycle saisonnier des populations microphytoplanctoniques. Une méthode d'analyse multi-tableaux (STATIS) est ensuite utilisée afin de comparer la variabilité temporelle des communautés microphytoplanctoniques sur 17 sites, répartis le long du littoral français. Trois zones géographiques sont distinguées. La connaissance de l'écologie des communautés caractéristiques de chaque zone met en évidence l'importance des facteurs hydrodynamiques sur la structure géographique des communautés microphytoplanctoniques le long des côtes françaises. Pour citer cet article : I. Gailhard et al., C. R. Biologies 326 (2003). The aim of this study is to characterize the large-scale geographical structures of microphytoplankton communities along French coasts. Once the temporal variability component shared by all sampled coastal sites was identified, and seasonal succession of microphytoplankton communities was described. A between-site analysis, using multitable comparison methods (STATIS), allowed the identification of three large areas according to the temporal variability patterns of microphytoplankton populations. The results indicate that the hydrodynamic characteristics of the different areas play a major role in the geographical structure of microalgal populations in mainland French coastal waters.

   abstract = {Plagiogrammaceae, a poorly described family of diatoms, are common inhabitants of the shallow marine littoral zone, occurring either in the sediments or as epiphytes. Previous molecular phylogenies of the Plagiogrammaceae were inferred but included only up to six genera: Plagiogramma, Dimeregramma, Neofragilaria, Talaroneis, Psammogramma and Psammoneis. In this paper, we describe a new plagiogrammoid genus, Orizaformis, obtained from Bohai Sea (China) and present molecular phylogenies of the family based on three and four genes (nuclear-encoded large and small subunit ribosomal RNAs and chloroplast-encoded rbcL and psbC). Also included in the new phylogenies is Glyphodesmis. The phylogenies suggest that the Plagiogrammaceae is composed of two major clades: one consisting of Talaroneis, Orizaformis and Psammoneis, and the second of Glyphodesmis, Psammogramma, Neofragilaria, Dimeregramma and Plagiogramma. In addition, we describe three new species within established genera: Psammoneis obaidii, which was collected from the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia; and Neofragilaria stilus and Talaroneis biacutifrons from the Mozambique Channel, Indian Ocean, and illustrate two new combination taxa: Neofragilaria anomala and Neofragilaria lineata. Our observations suggest that the biodiversity of the family is strongly needed to be researched, and the phylogenetic analyses provide a useful framework for future studies of Plagiogrammaceae.},

Whereas the previous revision was successful in re-introducing name stability to the classification, this revision provides a classification for lineages that were then still unresolved. The supergroups have withstood phylogenetic hypothesis testing with some modifications, but despite some progress, problematic nodes at the base of the eukaryotic tree still remain to be statistically resolved. Looking forward, subsequent transformations to our understanding of the diversity of life will be from the discovery of novel lineages in previously under-sampled areas and from environmental genomic information.},

   abstract = {Estimates of the order of magnitude for the total number of microbial species on Earth range from 10(3) to 10(9). Despite global dispersal of microorganisms, this number is probably rather large. The total biodiversity of an ecosystem is composed of two elements: first, a set of abundant taxa that carry out most ecosystem functions, grow actively and suffer intense losses through predation and viral lysis. These taxa are retrievable with molecular techniques but are difficult to grow in culture. Second, there is a seed bank of many rare taxa that are not growing or grow extremely slowly, do not experience viral lysis and predation is reduced. Such taxa are seldom retrieved by molecular techniques but many can be grown in culture, which explains the dictum 'everything is everywhere'.},

@article{Human2018,
   abstract = {Naturally-occurring pristine estuarine ecosystems are rare in modern environments due to anthropogenic encroachment. There are more than 100 outlets around the South African coast arising from streams flowing from small catchments close to the sea. Eight near natural systems were sampled seasonally over the period of a year to acquire baseline information on water quality and chlorophyll a status across a variety of algal guilds (benthic microalgae, phytoplankton and macroalgal cover). Albeit on a much smaller-scale, these systems represent natural surrogates of larger temporarily open/closed estuaries (TOCEs). Inorganic nutrients (ammonium, total oxidized nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphate), phytoplankton and microphytobenthos chlorophyll a, as well as macroagal percentage cover, were measured using standard methods. Algae showed a seasonal trend, with blooms of both micro- and macro-algae occurring during summer, with a dieback recorded in autumn. During summer, only one system had a phytoplankton peak in chlorophyll a above 20mugL(-1), while the microphytobenthos concentrations in three of the systems were above 100mgm(-2). Summer blooms of green filamentous macroalgae occurred in all four micro-outlets and in one micro-estuary. Using a linear mixed-effects modelling approach, significant drivers for algal growth related to temperature, nutrient conditions, light availability and water residence time, all of which are known to stimulate primary production. The results show that enrichment from natural sources display similar responses from primary producers to mesotrophic and/or eutrophic water bodies, with the exception that they revert to a natural state rather than continue into a degraded state as is the case in artificially enriched systems. This importantly demonstrates how larger temporarily/open closed estuaries, most of which are anthropogenically degraded, might have functioned under a former more balanced state. Some of these larger systems now respond to nutrient enrichment by exhibiting permanent cultural eutrophication.},

   abstract = {The number of extant species of diatoms is estimated here to be at least 30,000 and probably ca. 100,000, by extrapolation from an eclectic sample of genera and species complexes. Available data, although few, indicate that the pseudocryptic species being discovered in many genera are not functionally equivalent. Molecular sequence data show that some diatom species are ubiquitously dispersed. A good case can be made that at least some diatom species and even a few genera are endemics, but many such claims are still weak. The combination of very large species numbers and relatively rapid dispersal in diatoms is inconsistent with some versions of the "ubiquity hypothesis" of protist biogeography, and appears paradoxical. However, population genetic data indicate geographical structure in all the (few) marine and freshwater species that have been examined in detail, sometimes over distances of a few tens of kilometres. The mode of speciation may often be parapatric, in the context of a constantly shifting mosaic of temporarily isolated (meta) populations, but if our "intermediate dispersal hypothesis" is true (that long-distance dispersal is rare, but not extremely rare), allopatric speciation could also be maximized.},

   abstract = {As a step towards a global monograph of the freshwater diatom genus Sellaphora, we made detailed surveys of Sellaphora diversity in the epipelon of 38 lakes and ponds and three Holocene diatomites in the British Isles, restricting our analysis to those specimens that would be classified in S. americana, S. bacillum, S. pupula or S. laevissima according to the standard European diatom flora of KRAMMER & LANGE-BERTALOT (1986; Susswasserflora von Mitteleuropa, vol. 2/1. - G. Fischer, Stuttgart & New York). From a total of c. 10(4) specimens observed, over 3200 were recorded as digital images and sorted into 54 mostly informally-named phenodemes that can act as operational taxonomic units during future revisions. Of the 54 phenodemes, c. 40 are well-differentiated, while the others seem to intergrade and are in particular need of further study using morphometric, molecular and mating approaches. The limitations of conventional diatom taxonomy by visual comparison are clearly demonstrated. To help standardize identifications, published DNA sequences are assigned to some of the denies as 'molecular barcode'. The phenodemes of S. pupula sensu lato cannot be equated with the infraspecific taxa previously recorded for the British Isles and both these and most other pre-1990 records of species now assigned to Sellaphora must be regarded as having very little value for ecological and biogeographical purposes. Possible non-British records of the phenodemes are discussed but few are totally convincing; of those records most likely to be of the same phenodemes, the majority come from elsewhere in Europe.},

To circumvent this problem, this study adopted the complementary use of bioindicators representing different trophic levels and providing different type of information, in an innovative approach to integrate knowledge and to estimate the overall health state of ecosystems. The approach is illustrated using mercury contamination in primary producers (mosses), primary consumers (domestic pigeons and red-legged partridges) and top predators (Bonelli's eagles) in southern Portugal. Indicator kriging geostatistics was used to identify the areas where mercury concentration was higher than the median for each species, and to produce an index that combines mercury contamination across trophic levels. Spatial patterns of mercury contamination were consistent across species. The combined index provided a new level of information useful in incorporating measures of overall environmental contamination into pollution studies.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the effects of dredging on the structure and composition of diatom assemblages from a lowland stream and to investigate whether the response of diatom assemblages to the dredging is also influenced by different water quality. Three sampling sites were established in Rodriguez Stream (Argentina); physico-chemical variables and benthic diatom assemblages were sampled weekly in spring 2001. Species composition, cell density, diversity and evenness were estimated. Diatom tolerance to organic pollution and eutrophication were also analyzed. Differences in physico-chemical variables and changes in benthic diatom assemblages were compared between the pre- and post-dredging periods using a t-test. Data were analyzed using Principal Components Analysis (PCA), non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) ordination and cluster analysis. The effects of dredging in the stream involve two types of disturbances: (i) in the stream bed, by the removal and destabilization of the substrate and (ii) in the water column, by generating chemical changes and an alteration of the light environment of the stream. Suspended solids, soluble reactive phosphorus and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were significantly higher in post-dredging periods. Physical and chemical modifications in the habitat of benthic diatoms produced changes in the assemblage; diversity and species numbers showed an immediate increase after dredging, decreasing at the end of the study period. Changes in the tolerance of the diatom assemblage to organic pollution and eutrophication were also observed as a consequence of dredging; in the post-dredging period sensitive species were replaced by either tolerant or most tolerant species. These changes were particularly noticeable in site 1 (characterized by its lower amount of nutrients and organic matter previous to dredging), which showed an increase in the amount of nutrients and oxygen demand as a consequence of sediment removal. However, these changes were not so conspicuous in sites 2 and 3, which already presented a marked water quality deterioration before the execution of the dredging works.},

@article{Kroth2008,
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diatoms are unicellular algae responsible for approximately 20% of global carbon fixation. Their evolution by secondary endocytobiosis resulted in a complex cellular structure and metabolism compared to algae with primary plastids. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The whole genome sequence of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum has recently been completed. We identified and annotated genes for enzymes involved in carbohydrate pathways based on extensive EST support and comparison to the whole genome sequence of a second diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana. Protein localization to mitochondria was predicted based on identified similarities to mitochondrial localization motifs in other eukaryotes, whereas protein localization to plastids was based on the presence of signal peptide motifs in combination with plastid localization motifs previously shown to be required in diatoms. We identified genes potentially involved in a C4-like photosynthesis in P. tricornutum and, on the basis of sequence-based putative localization of relevant proteins, discuss possible differences in carbon concentrating mechanisms and CO(2) fixation between the two diatoms. We also identified genes encoding enzymes involved in photorespiration with one interesting exception: glycerate kinase was not found in either P. tricornutum or T. pseudonana. Various Calvin cycle enzymes were found in up to five different isoforms, distributed between plastids, mitochondria and the cytosol. Diatoms store energy either as lipids or as chrysolaminaran (a beta-1,3-glucan) outside of the plastids. We identified various beta-glucanases and large membrane-bound glucan synthases. Interestingly most of the glucanases appear to contain C-terminal anchor domains that may attach the enzymes to membranes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Here we present a detailed synthesis of carbohydrate metabolism in diatoms based on the genome sequences of Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. This model provides novel insights into acquisition of dissolved inorganic carbon and primary metabolic pathways of carbon in two different diatoms, which is of significance for an improved understanding of global carbon cycles.},

Classification based on functional criteria was also contrasted with taxonomic classification to assess whether these classification schemes produce different ordination patterns. Procrustean analyses indicated that ordination patterns generated with data based on the presence or absence of genera correlated significantly with the patterns generated by species density. Temporal trajectories of scores derived from functional groups significantly matched those derived from analyses based on quantitative data (density or biovolume) for genus or family. In general, the results indicated that some simplifications are justifiable, mainly when one takes into account the need for uninterrupted biomonitoring programs over large spatial scales in a continent-sized country with increasing environmental problems and with a relative paucity of scientists.},

In Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) demand the evaluation of the status with the overall objective of achieving at least "Good Status", by 2015 and 2020, respectively. For this purpose, Member States are required to evaluate different biological, physico-chemical and hydro-morphological quality elements (WFD), or qualitative descriptors (MSFD). The assessments of both, the phytoplankton element and the eutrophication descriptor should include several attributes, namely phytoplankton biomass, composition, abundance and blooms. However, few composition-based indicators have been proposed. Principally, phytoplankton still relies on chlorophyll-a concentration measurements, mainly due to the high cost of collecting information on this element and the difficulties establishing significant pressure-impact relationships. This investigation describes the difficulties in the development of a phytoplankton community composition indicator, the state of the art and the main challenges for the future.},

@article{Feio2014,
   abstract = {The present report describes a three-step approach that was used to characterize and define thresholds for the Least Disturbed Condition in Mediterranean streams of four different types, regarding organic pollution and nutrients, hydrological and morphological alterations, and land use. For this purpose, a common database composed of national reference sites (929 records) from seven countries, sampled for invertebrates, diatoms and macrophytes was used. The analyses of reference sites showed that small (catchment <100 km(2)) siliceous and non-siliceous streams were mainly affected by channelization, bank alteration and hydropeaking. Medium-sized siliceous rivers were the most affected by stressors: 25-43% of the samples showed at least slight alterations regarding channelization, connectivity, upstream dam influence, hydropeaking and degradation of riparian vegetation. Temporary streams were the least affected by hydromorphological changes, but they were nevertheless affected by alterations in riparian vegetation. There were no major differences between all permanent stream types regarding water quality, but temporary streams showed lower values for oxygenation (DO) and wider ranges for other variables, such as nitrates. A lower threshold value for DO (60%) was determined for this stream type and can be attributed to the streams' natural characteristics. For all other river types, common limits were found for the remaining variables (ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, total P, % of artificial areas, % of intensive and extensive agriculture, % of semi-natural areas in the catchment). These values were then used to select the list of reference sites. The biological communities were characterized, revealing the existence of nine groups of Mediterranean invertebrate communities, six for diatoms and five for macrophytes: each group was characterized by specific indicator taxa that highlighted the differences between groups.},

   abstract = {A new genus of moderately halophilic, moderately halotolerant and moderately thermophilic cyanobacteria with very thin trichomes is described. The four strains included in this genus were isolated from benthic microbial mats in a man-made hypersaline pond. Trichomes were around 1 microm thick, with small constrictions at the cross-walls and diffluent colorless sheaths. Thylakoids were parallel to the cell wall, but thylakoids and nucleoid were often excentrically arranged within the cytoplasm with respect to the main trichome axis. Strains grew at between 3.2 and 12-15% (w/v) salinity with optima between 3.2 and 12%. They showed lower temperature limits around 20 degrees C and upper limits between 45 and 50 degrees C, with optima between 28 and 45-50 degrees C. Carotenoid and mycosporine amino-acid complements were identical among strains. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that all strains were closely related (99% or higher similarity) and distantly related to other cyanobacteria (91% or lower similarity). We propose the new genus and species Halomicronema excentricum for these strains. The type strain is TFEP1.},

   abstract = {Dissolved and particulate lead were measured over an annual cycle (12 surveys between February 1998 and January 1999) in the Morlaix River estuary (Brittany, France). The concentrations were investigated in both the water column and the sediment of the river bottom in relation to hydrological conditions. In the water column, dissolved and particulate lead concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 4.4 nM and from 0.04 to 1.9 μmol g−1, respectively. Lead concentrations in surface sediment varied from 0.04 to 0.19 μmol g−1 and concentrations in the sediment pore water of the estuary were below the detection limit. Compared with the ranges known for pristine estuaries, concentrations of Pb in the water column of the Morlaix River estuary were found to be much higher. Concentrations of Pb also exceeded the lower range of those known for industrialized estuaries. Extensive agricultural activities in the drainage basin may be responsible for Pb levels above pristine conditions. Furthermore, the sediment appeared not to be contaminated. A mass balance was constructed quantifying all known sources and sinks for the Pb in the estuary. Riverine input accounts for most of the total annual metal flux. Burial in sediments was the major sink within the estuary, which acts as a trap especially for the particulate lead. The mass balance shows that the metal accumulation ranged between 414.6 and 446.0 kg year−1.},

Sediment samples were collected from three sites with different salinities, and at six time points over the year. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA and amoA gene fragments was used to identify the AOA and AOB present. Members of the AOA were mainly belonging to the Crenarchaeota Group 1, which were found at all sites, while members of the genus Nitrosomonas, which were abundant at the brackish sites, and of the genus Nitrosospira, which were present in early spring at the marine sites, were found to be the dominant AOB. Statistical analysis indicated that salinity and temperature were the main factors controlling the diversity and distribution of both AOA and AOB. Variability in net primary production rates was also correlated with species composition of both groups, but changes in the nitrite concentration only to the distribution of the AOA.},

   abstract = {The EC Water Framework Directive requires that ecological quality be assessed in transitional waters using the abundance and species composition of macroalgae. In estuaries, which form the majority of transitional waters, species composition is not a suitable measure. This arises from two features: (i) there is a continuous, natural change in species composition along the gradient of estuarine conditions which makes it difficult to know where within an estuary the species composition should be assessed, (ii) the inner estuarine macroalgal community of mat-forming species is very tolerant to both natural and anthropogenic stress and species poor which makes it insensitive to environmental variations in terms of species composition. An alternative feature is proposed based on the extent of upstream penetration of perennial fucoid algae. This proposal is founded on a series of case studies of the changes in fucoid limits, within a number of estuaries in the British Isles, consequent upon changes in pollution status over the last three decades. This also has to take into account variations of fucoid penetration owing to natural factors such as range of salinity variation and turbidity. The abundance criterion is taken to mean the absence of macroalgal blooms or "green tides", because general abundance of species is hard to quantify meaningfully in the upper estuarine mat-forming species and in the lower estuary is subject to great variation owing to the physical variability of estuary types.},

This paper describes assemblages above and below the works both before and after phosphorus stripping was installed. Taxa typical of eutrophic conditions dominated all samples, including those upstream of the works, suggesting that the river was already eutrophic before receiving the sewage effluent. Once nutrient removal was installed, phosphorus concentrations measured downstream of the works were similar to those measured upstream; however, there was little change in the diatom flora. Analysis of chemical data collected from the site suggest that the river may be nitrogen-limited for part of the year, and that, even with phosphorus stripping installed, the river still exceeds the Environment Agency's proposed interim targets for phosphorus concentrations in a eutrophic river.},

   abstract = {The slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata is an emblematic invasive species along the northeast Atlantic coast. This gregarious gastropod lives in stacks of several individuals and forms extended beds in shallow subtidal areas. The effects of this engineer species on the colonized habitat can be physical (e.g., presence of hard-shell substrates with uneven topography) or biological (e.g., nutrient enrichment by direct excretion or via biodeposition). We hypothesized that through biological activity, nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface are enhanced, leading to stimulated primary productivity by microphytobenthos (MPB) associated with Crepidula beds. To test this fertilization hypothesis, we conducted a 10-day mesocosm experiment using C. fornicata (live and dead) placed on top of sieved and homogenized sediment collected in situ. We used hyperspectral imaging to non-invasively map the development of MPB biomass, and to assess the potential influence of C. fornicata and its spatial extent. Our results showed that live C. fornicata significantly promote MPB growth through both physical and biological effects, with the biological effect dominating over the pure physical one. The highest stimulation was observed on the shells, suggesting that dissolved metabolic products excreted by C. fornicata were likely the main factor stimulating MPB growth in our short-term experiment. Our findings provide first direct evidence that stimulation of MPB growth by the biological activity of larger benthic epifauna occurs not only in intertidal but also in shallow subtidal habitats. More research is needed to assess the contribution of this fertilization effect to the trophic functioning of subtidal benthic systems.},

The new species has been found so far to be mainly epiphytic on bryophytes and aquatic vascular plants in carbonate springs and lakes of the Italian Alps. The environmental preferences of the new species, as assessed by the comparative analysis of these sites, appear to be quite distinctive. These freshwater habitats are fed by drainage basins dominated by dolomite lithology with medium mineralization, are oligotrophic, and are affected by seasonal desiccation.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: The close coupling of photosynthesis and light was studied in 2 contrasting diatom-dominated coastal sediments (sand and mud flats) using O<sub>2</sub> microelectrodes and fiber-optic microprobes for scalar irradiance. The diatom community of the muddy sediment was composed almost exclusively of motile epipelic species, whereas in the sandy sediment similar contributions of epipsammic and epipelic diatoms were observed. The attenuation coefficient of scalar irradiance (<i>K</i><sub>0</sub>) was significantly higher in the mud, where light was attenuated exponentially with depth from the sediment surface. In the sand, scalar irradiance levels increased in the first 0.1 0.2 mm due to high scattering and low absorption. Attenuation of scalar irradiance was highest for wavelengths of absorption by major diatom photopigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids). Higher areal and volumetric rates of O<sub>2</sub> respiration were found in illuminated sediments than those in the dark, resulting from an increase in both O<sub>2</sub> concentration and penetration depth and a direct stimulation of heterotrophic processes. A lower light acclimation index (<i>E</i><sub>k</sub>) was observed for the muddy sediment community, indicating lower light acclimation compared to the sandy sediment community. Areal and volumetric rates of photosynthesis were ~3 times higher in the muddy sediment. We conclude that higher photosynthetic rates in the finer sediment were determined by (1) a thinner and more densely populated photic zone, where the contribution of active photopigments to total light absorption relative to that of photosynthetically inactive components was higher, and (2) differences in diatom species composition and dominant life-strategies, specifically the capacity of cells to actively search for optimal light microenvironments in the fine-grained sediment.},

   abstract = {The role of epiphytes in an intertidal Zostera noltii seagrass bed in Marennes-Oléron Bay was assessed in comparison with the other main benthic primary producers (Z. noltii, microphytobenthos) at two bathymetric levels and on a seasonal basis. Assemblage and biomass of epiphytes were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Z. noltii and its detrital matter followed a typical seasonal pattern: microphytobenthos was present in large quantities throughout the year representing 21% of the total biomass while detrital matter, above-ground parts and below-ground parts accounted for 65, 9 and 5%, respectively. Only two species of epiphytic diatoms, Cocconeis scutellum and Cocconeis placentula, were observed on seagrass leaves. Epiphyte biomass was very low, representing on average less than 0.001% of that of microphytobenthos or leaves. This low epiphyte biomass is linked with the absence of macroalgae and also with the low biovolume of Cocconeis, which formed a monolayer of cells on leaves. This can be explained by the severe conditions of the intertidal and the high leaf turn-over of Z. noltii leaves.},

   abstract = {The occurrence of cryptic and pseudocryptic species, often living in sympatry, is widespread among microalgae. This phenomenon raises important questions about niche partitioning between these closely related species. To date, however, few studies have addressed the ecological mechanisms underlying sympatry in cryptic and pseudocryptic species. As a result, we have only a limited understanding of the factors that govern their distribution along environmental gradients. Here, we used the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 18S rRNA gene, and the RUBISCO LSU (rbcL) chloroplast gene sequence data together with cell wall morphology to show that estuarine populations of the widespread and common benthic diatom Navicula phyllepta Kütz. consist of pseudocryptic species. Growth rate measurements in function of salinity showed that N. phyllepta strains assigned to the different species differed in their tolerance to low salinities (&lt;5 practical salinity units, psu), which was reflected by their different (but widely overlapping) distribution in the Westerschelde estuary (the Netherlands). Multiple regression analyses of the factors determining the abundance of the different species in field samples revealed that, in addition to salinity, sediment type and ammonium concentrations were probably equally important. Our results show that N. phyllepta sensu lato comprises different species with specialized ecophysiological characteristics rather than generalists with a broad adaptability to different environmental conditions.},

   abstract = {Much of global gold production has come from deposits with uneconomic concentrations of base metals, such as copper, lead and zinc. These 'gold-only' deposits are thought to have formed from hot, aqueous fluids rich in carbon dioxide, but only minor significance has been attached to the role of the CO2 in the process of gold transport. This is because chemical bonding between gold ions and CO2 species is not strong, and so it is unlikely that CO2 has a direct role in gold transport. An alternative indirect role for CO2 as a weak acid that buffers pH has also appeared unlikely, because previously inferred pH values for such gold-bearing fluids are variable. Here we show that such calculated pH values are unlikely to record conditions of gold transport, and propose that CO2 may play a critical role during gold transport by buffering the fluid in a pH range where elevated gold concentration can be maintained by complexation with reduced sulphur. Our conclusions, which are supported by geochemical modelling, may provide a platform for new gold exploration methods.},

   abstract = {We investigated the membrane properties and dominant ionic conductances in the plasma membrane of the calcifying marine phytoplankton Coccolithus pelagicus using the patch-clamp technique. Whole-cell recordings obtained from decalcified cells revealed a dominant anion conductance in response to membrane hyperpolarization. Ion substitution showed that the anion channels were selective for Cl(-) and Br(-) over other anions, and the sensitivity to the stilbene derivative 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, ethacrynic acid, and Zn(2+) revealed a pharmacological profile typical of many plant and animal anion channels. Voltage activation and kinetic characteristics of the C. pelagicus Cl(-) channel are consistent with a novel function in plants as the inward rectifier that tightly regulates membrane potential. Membrane depolarization gave rise to nonselective cation currents and in some cases evoked action potential currents. We propose that these major ion conductances play an essential role in membrane voltage regulation that relates to the unique transport physiology of these calcifying phytoplankton.},

   abstract = {Inverted microscopy is widespread employed for the analysis of phytoplankton composition within water quality monitoring networks. However, the analysis at the lowest taxonomical level is not always required for ecological status assessment. In addition, inverted microscopy can underestimate the small phytoplankton, and not always distinguish photoautotrophic from heterotrophic cells. In this study, as alternative tools, epifluorescence microscopy and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) were employed to characterize phytoplankton communities within waters of different trophic condition. Epifluorescence microscopy confirmed its effectiveness to count the small phytoplankton. Furthermore, significant correlations between nutrients of anthropogenic origin and nanoplankton abundances were found. However, this technique resulted very time-consuming. HPLC together with the CHEMTAX program was more appropriate than inverted microscopy, in terms of cost-effectiveness. Also, the main variability patterns observed in the phytoplankton community structure by HPLC coincided with previous findings in the study area. Nevertheless, a rapid screening at the inverted microscope is recommended.},

The impact of grazing on the benthic diatom populations was studied by field observations and feeding experiments on a few abundant members of the community. Only small fractions of the microphytobenthic biomass and production are converted by herbivores. A hypothesis is presented explaining the growth kinetics and productivity of diatom populations and the inefficient transfer of carbon into herbivore foodchains. Data on feeding rate and population dynamics of the nematode species, Eudiplogaster pararmatus, are discussed in view of the seasonal succession of edible diatom species.},

   abstract = {Summary 1. Species traits have been frequently used in ecological studies in an attempt to develop a general ecological framework linking biological communities to habitat pressures. The trait approach offers a mechanistic alternative to traditional taxonomy-based descriptors. This review focuses on research employing traits as biomonitoring tools for freshwater ecosystems, although the lessons learned have wider application in the assessment of other ecosystem types. 2. We review the support from ecological theory to employ species traits for biomonitoring purposes (e.g. the habitat templet concept, landscape filtering hypothesis), and the subsequent studies that test the hypotheses arising from these theories, and apply this knowledge under real freshwater biomonitoring scenarios. We also include studies that deal with more specific issues such as trait trade-offs and trait syndromes. 3. We highlight the functional trait approach as one of the most promising tools emerging for biomonitoring freshwater ecosystems. Several technical issues are addressed and solutions are proposed. We discuss the need for: a broader unified trait biomonitoring tool; a more accurate understanding of the natural variation of community patterns of trait expression; approaches to diminish the effects of trait trade-offs and trait syndromes; additional life history and ecological requirement studies; and the detection of specific impacts under multiple stressor scenarios. 4. Synthesis and applications. This review provides biologists with the conceptual underpinning for the use of species traits as community descriptors and for freshwater biomonitoring and management. We expect that the functional trait approach will ultimately improve communication to managers and legislators of the importance of protecting freshwater ecosystem functions.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: Microphytobenthos (MPB) contribute significantly to primary production in many estuarine and coastal waters. Although the vertical migration of microphytobenthos is well integrated into benthic studies of intertidal areas, the presence and importance of such migration has not yet been investigated in subtidal areas. <i>In situ</i> measurements and sampling in the Bay of Brest, French Atlantic coast, in November 2003 and May, July and September 2004 and subsequent laboratory experiments showed that pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry can be employed to follow vertical migration of subtidal MPB. Steady-state fluorescence (<i>F</i>) was highly correlated with chlorophyll <i>a</i> (chl <i>a</i>) concentrations in the top 200 µm of sediments and could be used to detect <i>in situ</i> changes in MPB biomass. When (as in the present study) subtidal variations in light and temperature are negligible compared to those in intertidal areas, variations in fluorescence parameters due to changes in chl <i>a</i> concentrations are much greater than those due to photochemical and non-photochemical quenching. <i>In situ</i> surveys during 3 seasons showed a daily bell-like periodicity in <i>F</i>, regardless of tidal oscillations. Sediment cores incubated at constant light and temperature displayed similar day/night fluorescence variations, indicating an endogenous rhythm, and that the diel cycle is the main factor triggering migration. Our results revealed a difference in the functioning of subtidal and intertidal MPB, in which migration is linked not only to diel but also to tidal cycles. In future studies of subtidal benthic primary production, care should be taken in sampling strategies, particularly in selecting sampling times, as the migratory behaviour of the MPB may greatly alter estimates of available or actively photosynthesising biomass.},

   abstract = {One lineage of pennate diatoms has a slit through the siliceous cell wall, called a "raphe," that functions in motility. Raphid pennate diatoms number in the perhaps tens of thousands of species, with the diversity of raphe forms potentially matching this number. Three lineages-the Bacillariales, Rhopalodiales, and Surirellales-possess a complex and presumably highly derived raphe that is physically separated from the cell interior, most often by a set of siliceous braces. Because the relationship among these three lineages is unclear, the number of origins of the canal raphe system and the homology of it and its constitutive parts among these lineages, is equally unclear. We reconstructed the phylogeny of raphid pennate diatoms and included, for the first time, members of all three canal raphid diatom lineages, and used the phylogeny to test specific hypotheses about the origin of the canal raphe. The canal raphe appears to have evolved twice, once in the common ancestor of Bacillariales and once in the common ancestor of Rhopalodiales and Surirellales, which form a monophyletic group in our analyses. These results recommend careful follow-up morphogenesis studies of the canal raphe in these two lineages to determine the underlying developmental basis for this remarkable case of parallel evolution.},

A large majority (78-83% of each population) of the male lineages could be classified as belonging to three basic Y chromosomal haplogroups, R1b, J, and E3b. While R1b, accounting for more than half of the lineages in any of the Portuguese sub-populations, is a characteristic marker of many different West European populations, haplogroups J and E3b consist of lineages that are typical of the circum-Mediterranean region or even East Africa. The highly diverse haplogroup E3b in Portuguese likely combines sub-clades of distinct origins. The present composition of the Y chromosomes in Portugal in this haplogroup likely reflects a pre-Arab component shared with North African populations or testifies, at least in part, to the influence of Sephardic Jews. In contrast to the marginally low sub-Saharan African Y chromosome component in Portuguese, such lineages have been detected at a moderately high frequency in our previous survey of mtDNA from the same samples, indicating the presence of sex-related gene flow, most likely mediated by the Atlantic slave trade.},

Eight sites along the estuary were sampled during 2007–2008 both at superficial and deep water layers, in order to gather both horizontal and vertical estuarine physicochemical and hydrological gradients. Canonical Variates Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis segregated diatom community in two assemblages depending on the dynamics of the salt-wedge.

   abstract = {Physiological and behavioral photoprotection are the two major mechanisms by which natural microphytobenthic assemblages protect themselves against high light. These mechanisms were investigated with high vertical resolution in intertidal epipelic (mud) and epipsammic (sand) benthic diatom communities. Photophobic cell migration was found in epipelic communities when exposed to high light, detected using pigment analysis of 200 [mu]m sediment depth layers and Low Temperature Scanning Electron Microscopy. In the mud, significant differences between migratory and non-migratory (Latrunculin A-treated) biofilms were observed in the photosynthetic activity measured using rapid light curves: after exposure to high light, non-migratory biofilms showed lower light use efficiency (lower [alpha]) and lower maximum photosynthetic capacity (lower rETRmax). Increased de-epoxidation state (DPS) was observed in both epipelic and epipsammic diatom assemblages after exposure to high light: in the surface 400 [mu]m for mud and throughout the sediment profile up to 1 mm for sand. The two diatom communities showed different photoregulatory strategies: the epipelic community of muddy sediments photoregulated using both physiological and behavioral photoprotection, while the epipsammic community of sandy sediments used exclusively physiological mechanisms.},

   abstract = {Among the most studied relationships in ecology are those of population density with (1) body size and (2) species distribution. The first relationship, in conjunction with metabolic rate, determines the energy flows through species communities, whereas the second relationship shows how local communities are influenced by the species history of dispersal and establishment. Traditionally, these two relationships have been examined separately. Here, I explored how diatom density was affected by cell size (biovolume) and species distribution in benthic and planktonic stream habitats all the way from individual localities and hydrologic systems (regions) to the entire United States. At all scales, density was predominantly a negative function of biovolume and a positive function of distribution. Biovolume was more strongly related to density in the benthos than in the phytoplankton. Partial regressions revealed that biovolume, by itself, explained a substantially higher percentage of the variance in density at local than at regional and continental scales. Conversely, species distribution was a much more important descriptor of density at larger scales and a slightly better predictor than biovolume at local scales. At large scales density was explained primarily by distribution and, to a lesser extent and only in the benthos, by the covariance of distribution and biovolume, whereas biovolume was a marginal predictor in all habitats. This discovery suggests that the strong relationships between density and body size, reported for populations ranging from unicellular algae to mammals, may be less direct than previously thought but mediated by large-scale species distributions.},

Silica is an inorganic amorphous oxide formed by polymerization processes within plants. There has been much research to gain new insights into its biochemistry and to mimic biosilicification. We review the background on plant silica bodies, silica uptake mechanisms and applications, and suggest possible ways of producing plant silica bodies with new functions. Silica bodies offer complementary properties to diatoms for nanotechnology, including large-scale availability from crop wastes, lack of organic impurities (in some), microencapsulation and microcrystalline quartz with possibly unique optical properties.},

   abstract = {1. Little consensus has been reached as to general features of spatial variation in beta diversity, a fundamental component of species diversity. This could reflect a genuine lack of simple gradients in beta diversity, or a lack of agreement as to just what constitutes beta diversity. Unfortunately, a large number of approaches have been applied to the investigation of variation in beta diversity, which potentially makes comparisons of the findings difficult. 2. We review 24 measures of beta diversity for presence/absence data (the most frequent form of data to which such measures are applied) that have been employed in the literature, express many of them for the first time in common terms, and compare some of their basic properties. 3. Four groups of measures are distinguished, with a fundamental distinction arising between 'broad sense' measures incorporating differences in composition attributable to species richness gradients, and 'narrow sense' measures that focus on compositional differences independent of such gradients. On a number of occasions on which the former have been employed in the literature the latter may have been more appropriate, and there are many situations in which consideration of both kinds of measures would be valuable. 4. We particularly recommend (i) considering beta diversity measures in terms of matching/mismatching components (usually denoted a , b and c) and thereby identifying the contribution of different sources of variation in species composition, and (ii) the use of ternary plots to express the relationship between the values of these measures and of the components, and as a way of understanding patterns in beta diversity.},

   abstract = {A broad swath of eukaryotic microbial biodiversity cannot be cultivated in the lab and is therefore inaccessible to conventional genome-wide comparative methods. One promising approach to study these lineages is single cell genomics (SCG), whereby an individual cell is captured from nature and genome data are produced from the amplified total DNA. Here we tested the efficacy of SCG to generate a draft genome assembly from a single sample, in this case a cell belonging to the broadly distributed MAST-4 uncultured marine stramenopiles. Using de novo gene prediction, we identified 6,996 protein-encoding genes in the MAST-4 genome. This genetic inventory was sufficient to place the cell within the ToL using multigene phylogenetics and provided preliminary insights into the complex evolutionary history of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the MAST-4 lineage.},

   abstract = {Eutrophication and acidification are among the major stressors on freshwater ecosystems in northern Europe and North America, but possible consequences of interactions between pH and nutrients on ecological status assessment and species richness patterns have not previously been assessed. Using data from 52 river sites throughout Norway, we investigated the combined effects of pH and nutrients on benthic algae assemblages, specifically 1) taxa-specific couplings between nutrient and acidity traits, 2) the degree of consistency between different biotic indices, separately for nutrients and acid conditions, 3) the impact of pH on nutrient indices and phosphorus on indices of acid conditions, and 4) the impact of pH and phosphorus supply on diatom and non-diatom taxon richness. We found that 1) acid-tolerant taxa are generally associated with nutrient-poor conditions, with only a few exceptions; this is probably more a consequence of habitat availability than reflecting true ecological niches; 2) correlation coefficients between nutrient indices and TP, as well as acid conditions indices and pH were barely affected when the confounding factor was removed; 3) the association of acid-tolerant taxa with nutrient-poor conditions means that the lowest possible nutrient index at a site, as indicated by benthic algae, is lower at acid than at circumneutral sites. Although this may be an artifact of the datasets from which taxa-specific indicator values were derived, it could lead to a drift in nutrient indices with recovery from acidification; 4) the response of non-diatom taxon richness follows a complex pattern with a synergistic interaction between nutrient supply and pH. In contrast, diatom richness follows a simple additive pattern; this suggests structural differences between diatoms and non-diatom benthic algae in their response to nutrient supply and pH; diatom taxon richness tended to increase with nutrient supply, while non-diatom richness decreased.},

   abstract = {Electric power generation in the United States uses substantial amounts of fuel oil #6. Orimulsion, an emulsion of bitumen, water, and a surfactant, is an alternative. A portion of the information that managers need to compare the two fuels is their relative environmental impacts. Both fuels are shipped by sea, so the impact of spills on the marine benthos is a concern. We used microcosms to assess the relative impacts of simulated spills of these fuels on the microalgae of shallow subtidal sandy bottoms. Response variables included microalgal abundance, primary productivity, ratio of chlorophyll a to phaeophytin, and ratio of primary production to chlorophyll a. During our 88-day experiment, we found no significant differences between the fuels for any variable. We suggest that weathering before the spill reaches the shore removes the most toxic components, rendering the fuels essentially equal in their impact on benthic microalgae.},

   abstract = {Estuaries cover <1% of marine habitats, but the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) effluxes from these net heterotrophic systems contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle. Anthropogenic eutrophication of estuarine waterways increases the supply of labile substrates to the underlying sediments. How such changes affect the form and functioning of the resident microbial communities remains unclear. We employed a carbon-13 pulse-chase experiment to investigate how a temperate estuarine benthic microbial community at 6.5 degrees C responded to additions of marine diatom-derived organic carbon equivalent to 4.16, 41.60 and 416.00 mmol C m(-2). The quantities of carbon mineralized and incorporated into bacterial biomass both increased significantly, albeit differentially, with resource supply. This resulted in bacterial growth efficiency increasing from 0.40 +/- 0.02 to 0.55 +/- 0.04 as substrates became more available. The proportions of diatom-derived carbon incorporated into individual microbial membrane fatty acids also varied with resource supply. Future increases in labile organic substrate supply have the potential to increase both the proportion of organic carbon being retained within the benthic compartment of estuaries and also the absolute quantity of CO(2) outgassing from these environments.},

Diatom samples were collected from 31 sites (14 freshwater, 10 brackish and 7 marine), which included less impacted (upstream) and impacted (downstream) sites in each water type. Our results showed higher abundance and biodiversity of periphytic diatoms at the less impacted sites in terms of species richness, Shannon index, cell count and biovolume of the communities than at the impacted sites for freshwater and estuarine sites, but not for marine sites. 84 diatom species were noted in freshwater, 80 in brackish water and 40 in marine waters. In comparison to diatoms of the impacted sites, those of less impacted freshwater, brackish and marine sites had less lipid bodies (also less biovolume) and a lower percentage of teratological frustules, and showed more mobile forms in the community. Principal component analysis (PCA) also showed clear segregation of impacted from less impacted sites by the extent of the presence of lipid bodies (higher both in number and biovolume) and deformities in diatom frustules. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that lipid body induction and deformities were positively correlated with metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn) and nutrients (total phosphorus and total nitrogen), whereas they showed negative correlation with salinity, dissolved oxygen, suspended solutes and pH. Life-forms, lipid bodies and deformities in diatoms may be an effective biomonitoring tool for assessing biological effects of pollutants in non-marine aquatic ecosystems in Korea.},

@book{Paterson2003,
   abstract = {The understanding of the complexity of benthic biofilms has progressed rapidly in recent years, as technological advances have allowed analysis of biofilms on more relevant temporal and spatial scales. However, many different forms of biofilms exist and few have been extensively studied. Biofilms form on any submerged or intermittently submerged surface and most follow a known progression of development (or succession) towards an equilibrium state related to environmental conditions. A particularly dynamic sub-section of benthic biofilms are transient films that self-assemble and disperse in response to environmental conditions at the surface of intertidal cohesive or mixed sediment systems (Paterson and Hagerthey 2001). These biofilms are comprised of motile autotrophic cells, given the collective term microphytobenthos, and are largely comprised of diatom, euglenid flagellates and cyanobacteria. A primary characteristic of these organisms is their ability to migrate through sediments in response to environmental cues and their inherent biological rhythms (Admiraal 1984). Transient biofilms have a variable life-span related to the differential pressures of tidal exposure, light conditions, grazing and hydrodynamic forcing. These biofilms are formed from a matrix of cells and associated extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that many microphytobenthic cells extrude through locomotion (Edgar and Pickett-Heaps, 1984). It is arguable that in terms of temporal and spatial variability, transient biofilms are a particularly complex group. Transient biofilms can form rapidly (within 20 min) (Paterson et al. 1998) and usually disperse shortly before or after the tidal exposure period ends. At their most basic they may comprise a single layer of cells (Paterson et al. 1998) or develop into a coherent matrix of cells and polymeric substances, sometimes several mm in depth. The formation of more sturdy biofilms may lead to microbial mat formation and the system loses its transient nature, being retained over several tidal cycles, or even become semi-permanent on a seasonal basis. An example of these semipermanent biofilms is the “bubble mat” system described in literature (Yallop et al. 1994).},

   abstract = {Estuaries have long been regarded as environmentally naturally stressed areas because of the high degree of variability in their physico-chemical characteristics, for example oxygen, temperature and salinity in the water column and bed sediment dynamics. However, their biota is well-adapted to cope with that stress and so the areas may be regarded as resilient because of that inherent variability; their ability to absorb stress without adverse effects is regarded here as Environmental Homeostasis. Hence these areas may only be regarded as stressful for marine or freshwater-adapted organisms and that for estuarine organisms this environmental stress is regarded as a subsidy whereby they successfully capitalise on the stressful conditions. In addition, using examples of the estuarine fauna and flora, this article indicates that the characteristics of natural stress in estuaries are similar to those for anthropogenic stress. An over-reliance on ecosystem structural features, such as diversity, in quality indicators therefore makes the detection of the anthropogenic stress more difficult. This difficulty is termed the Estuarine Quality Paradox. Because of these difficulties, the article argues that functional characteristics either as well as or rather than structural ones should be used in detecting environmental perturbations in estuaries.},

   abstract = {A current predominant paradigm emphasizes the role of epiphytic algae for invertebrates in most seagrass food webs. However, in some intertidal Zostera noltii beds, epiphyte biomass is very low compared to microphytobenthos and seagrass biomasses. We assessed the role of microphytobenthos in a temperate intertidal Z. noltii bed by combining stable isotope and fatty acid (FA) analyses on primary producers, composite sources — suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) and sediment surface organic matter (SSOM) — and the main macrofaunal consumers. Z. noltii showed high δ13C (−9.9‰) and high 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-3) contents. Microphytobenthos was slightly more 13C-depleted (−15.4‰) and had high levels of diatom markers: 14:0, 16:1(n-7)c, 20:5(n-3). Low mean δ13C (−22.0‰) and large amounts of diatom and bacteria (18:1(n-7)c) markers indicated that SPOM was mainly composed of a mixture of fresh and decayed pelagic diatoms. Higher mean δ13C (−17.9‰) and high amounts of diatom FAs were found in SSOM, showing that microphytobenthic diatoms dominate. Very low percentages of 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-3) in consumers indicated a low contribution of Z. noltii material to their diets. Grazers, deposit and suspension-deposit feeders had δ13C close to microphytobenthos and high levels of diatom FAs, confirming that microphytobenthos represented the main part of their diet. Lower δ13C and higher amounts of flagellate FAs – 22:6(n-3) and 16:4(n-3) – in suspension feeders indicated that their diet resulted from a mixture of SPOM and microphytobenthos. These results demonstrate that invertebrates do not consume high amounts of seagrass and highlight the main role of benthic diatoms in this intertidal seagrass bed.},

   abstract = {This is an exploration of contemporary protist taxonomy within an ecological perspective. As it currently stands, the 'morphospecies' does not accommodate the information that might support a truly ecological species concept for the protists. But the 'morphospecies' is merely a first step in erecting a taxonomy of the protists, and it is expected to become more meaningful in the light of genetic, physiological and ecological research in the near future. One possible way forward lies in the recognition that sexual and asexual protists may all be subject to forces of cohesion that result in (DNA) sequence-similarity clusters. A starting point would then be the detection of 'ecotypes'--where genotypic and phenotypic clusters correspond; but for that we need better information regarding the extent of clonality in protists, and better characterization of ecological niches and their boundaries. There is some progress with respect to the latter. Using the example of a community of ciliated protozoa living in the stratified water column of a freshwater pond, it is shown to be possible to gauge the potential of protists to partition their local environment into ecological niches. Around 40 morphospecies can coexist in the superimposed water layers, which presumably represent different ecological niches, but we have yet to discover if these are discrete or continuously variable. It is a myth that taxonomic problems are more severe for protists than for animals and plants. Most of the fundamental problems associated with species concepts (e.g. asexuals, sibling species, phenotypic variation) are distributed across biota in general. The recent history of the status of Pfiesteria provides a model example of an integrated approach to solving what are essentially taxonomic problems.},

   abstract = {The architecture of mutualistic networks facilitates coexistence of individual participants by minimizing competition relative to facilitation. However, it is not known whether this benefit is received by each participant node in proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence. This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced by individual nodes in a network. We address this question by applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here we report two main results. First, nodes contribute heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a strong contributor tends to decrease overall network persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor. Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of these results to other cooperative networks by analysing a 15-year time series of the interactions between designer and contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As with the ecological networks, a firm's survival probability decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases. Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially address questions about the impact of invasive species in ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems.},

We investigated the morphology and life cycle in three clones of N. fonticola and all exhibited reduced sexuality, with pedogamous production of auxospores in unpaired gametangia. The auxospores of all clones contained tangles of striplike elements that lay outside the perizonium and were distinct from it in structure and ontogeny. We introduce a new term, incunabula, to refer to such components of the auxospore wall. Semicryptic variation was detected: one clone differed from the other two in valve size and shape, stria density, and fibula density, as well as its nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) sequence. The implications of reduced sexuality for the taxonomy of sect. Lanceolatae are discussed. A lectotype is designated for N. fonticola from among original material of Grunow, and the application of the name is clarified further by designating illustrations and the LSU sequence AM182191 from one of our clones as epitypes.},

@article{Barnett2015,
   abstract = {In intertidal marine sediments, characterized by rapidly fluctuating and often extreme light conditions, primary production is frequently dominated by diatoms. We performed a comparative analysis of photophysiological traits in 15 marine benthic diatom species belonging to the four major morphological growth forms (epipelon (EPL), motile epipsammon (EPM-M) and non-motile epipsammon (EPM-NM) and tychoplankton (TYCHO)) found in these sediments. Our analyses revealed a clear relationship between growth form and photoprotective capacity, and identified fast regulatory physiological photoprotective traits (that is, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and the xanthophyll cycle (XC)) as key traits defining the functional light response of these diatoms. EPM-NM and motile EPL showed the highest and lowest NPQ, respectively, with EPM-M showing intermediate values. Like EPL, TYCHO had low NPQ, irrespective of whether they were grown in benthic or planktonic conditions, reflecting an adaptation to a low light environment. Our results thus provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of a trade-off between behavioural (motility) and physiological photoprotective mechanisms (NPQ and the XC) in the four major intertidal benthic diatoms growth forms using unialgal cultures. Remarkably, although motility is restricted to the raphid pennate diatom clade, raphid pennate species, which have adopted a non-motile epipsammic or a tychoplanktonic life style, display the physiological photoprotective response typical of these growth forms. This observation underscores the importance of growth form and not phylogenetic relatedness as the prime determinant shaping the physiological photoprotective capacity of benthic diatoms.},

   abstract = {Diatom-based ecological quality assessment methods have been implemented and used regularly in the Water Framework Directive. These indices use the species' abundance profiles along a specific environmental gradient, which they aim to assess. However, this approach has several problematic issues including the unstable and fast-changing diatom taxonomy. The use of traits can be a solution if their responses to the environmental pressure are well-defined. Here, we developed taxonomy-based and trait-based diatom assemblage indices to assess the ecological status of riverine sites on a tropical island. The two indices are based on two sub-indices that measure the diatom assemblage response to a nutrient and organic matter/turbidity gradient. Both taxonomy- and trait-based indices correlated significantly with the selected environmental gradients of the test database, which was not used during index development. We showed that traits could be used for quality assessment of the Mayotte rivers and require much less effort than taxonomy-based indices. There were differences between the two types of indices, which are discussed in this paper. As a perspective for further studies, tests of trait-based indices among different eco-regions would be challenging.},

   abstract = {How microbial communities change over time in response to the environment is poorly understood. Previously a six-year time series of 16S rRNA V6 data from the Western English Channel demonstrated robust seasonal structure within the bacterial community, with diversity negatively correlated with day-length. Here we determine whether metagenomes and metatranscriptomes follow similar patterns. We generated 16S rRNA datasets, metagenomes (1.2 GB) and metatranscriptomes (157 MB) for eight additional time points sampled in 2008, representing three seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer) and including day and night samples. This is the first microbial 'multi-omic' study to combine 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiling. Five main conclusions can be drawn from analysis of these data: 1) Archaea follow the same seasonal patterns as Bacteria, but show lower relative diversity; 2) Higher 16S rRNA diversity also reflects a higher diversity of transcripts; 3) Diversity is highest in winter and at night; 4) Community-level changes in 16S-based diversity and metagenomic profiles are better explained by seasonal patterns (with samples closest in time being most similar), while metatranscriptomic profiles are better explained by diel patterns and shifts in particular categories (i.e., functional groups) of genes; 5) Changes in key genes occur among seasons and between day and night (i.e., photosynthesis); but these samples contain large numbers of orphan genes without known homologues and it is these unknown gene sets that appear to contribute most towards defining the differences observed between times. Despite the huge diversity of these microbial communities, there are clear signs of predictable patterns and detectable stability over time. Renewed and intensified efforts are required to reveal fundamental deterministic patterns in the most complex microbial communities. Further, the presence of a substantial proportion of orphan sequences underscores the need to determine the gene products of sequences with currently unknown function.},

   abstract = {The recent emergence of barcoding approaches coupled to those of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has raised new perspectives for studying environmental communities. In this framework, we tested the possibility to derive accurate inventories of diatom communities from pyrosequencing outputs with an available DNA reference library. We used three molecular markers targeting the nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes (SSU rDNA, rbcL and cox1) and three samples of a mock community composed of 30 known diatom strains belonging to 21 species. In the goal to detect methodological biases, one sample was constituted directly from pooled cultures, whereas the others consisted of pooled PCR products. The NGS reads obtained by pyrosequencing (Roche 454) were compared first to a DNA reference library including the sequences of all the species used to constitute the mock community, and second to a complete DNA reference library with a larger taxonomic coverage. A stringent taxonomic assignation gave inventories that were compared to the real one. We detected biases due to DNA extraction and PCR amplification that resulted in false-negative detection. Conversely, pyrosequencing errors appeared to generate false positives, especially in case of closely allied species. The taxonomic coverage of DNA reference libraries appears to be the most crucial factor, together with marker polymorphism which is essential to identify taxa at the species level. RbcL offers a high resolving power together with a large DNA reference library. Although needing further optimization, pyrosequencing is suitable for identifying diatom assemblages and may find applications in the field of freshwater biomonitoring.},

   abstract = {Much of our current knowledge on the mechanisms by which Ca(2+) signals are generated in photosynthetic eukaryotes comes from studies of a relatively small number of model species, particularly green plants and algae, revealing some common features and notable differences between 'plant' and 'animal' systems. Physiological studies from a broad range of algal cell types have revealed the occurrence of animal-like signalling properties, including fast action potentials and fast propagating cytosolic Ca(2+) waves. Genomic studies are beginning to reveal the widespread occurrence of conserved channel types likely to be involved in Ca(2+) signalling. However, certain widespread 'ancient' channel types appear to have been lost by certain groups, such as the embryophytes. More recent channel gene loss is also evident from comparisons of more closely related algal species. The underlying processes that have given rise to the current distributions of Ca(2+) channel types include widespread retention of ancient Ca(2+) channel genes, horizontal gene transfer (including symbiotic gene transfer and acquisition of bacterial genes), gene loss and gene expansion within taxa. The assessment of the roles of Ca(2+) channel genes in diverse physiological, developmental and life history processes represents a major challenge for future studies.},

   abstract = {Diatoms are the most successful group of eukaryotic phytoplankton in the modern ocean and have risen to dominance relatively quickly over the last 100 million years. Recently completed whole genome sequences from two species of diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, have revealed a wealth of information about the evolutionary origins and metabolic adaptations that have led to their ecological success. A major finding is that they have incorporated genes both from their endosymbiotic ancestors and by horizontal gene transfer from marine bacteria. This unique melting pot of genes encodes novel capacities for metabolic management, for example, allowing the integration of a urea cycle into a photosynthetic cell. In this review we show how genome-enabled approaches are being leveraged to explore major phenomena of oceanographic and biogeochemical relevance, such as nutrient assimilation and life histories in diatoms. We also discuss how diatoms may be affected by climate change-induced alterations in ocean processes.},

   abstract = {Spatial and interannual variations of phytoplankton diversity were characterized along the French Atlantic Coast in relation to physical factors and large-scale climatic indices using phytoplankton surveys conducted from 1993 to 2010 in four geographical areas. This study relates phytoplankton diversity to oyster recruitment success by comparing a ‘specific’ versus a ‘functional’ diversity approach. Functional diversity was represented by functional groups of different phytoplanktonic functional traits (size, shape, toxicity), relevant for oyster feeding during growth, reproduction and larval development. Phytoplankton diversity patterns along the French Atlantic coast corresponded to a geographical distribution mainly driven by a latitudinal gradient and hydrodynamic features as confirmed by the functional characteristics of the indicator species recorded for each geographical area (C-S-R strategies of Reynolds, specific habitat). This geographical typology was less clear for functional diversity. Only few functional groups were explained by physical factors: the non-toxic small and solitary cells were in particular related to temperature, with high densities observed in the southern areas. Even if temporal variation was less important in explaining the phytoplankton diversity patterns, the main drivers explaining the interannual pattern were the large-scale climatic indices, mainly the Atlantic Multidecennal Oscillation. Functional groups were readily explained by climatic indices than species even if the relationships cannot be applied generally because of the non-linearity of the correlations (local and temporal variations). However, the potentially toxic, small and linear phytoplankton were anticorrelated to NAO. The functional approach thus brings constructive elements concerning the relationships between the prey assemblage of oysters and their physical drivers. Redundancy and co-inertia analyses appeared as complementary analyses in investigating phytoplankton pattern of variation, being particularly useful in analyzing geographical and temporal diversity fluctuation, respectively.},

   abstract = {Functional classification based on species traits brought a revolution in community ecology, and also boosted phytoplankton and in phytobenton (diatom) research. Several studies stressed the usefulness of phytoplankton functional groups in ecological status assessment, and there is also a strong emphasis to use combined traits in ecological assessments of diatom assemblages. The Combined Eco-Morphological Functional Groups (CEMFGs) help to reveal species-environmental correlations, which can be hidden, controlling traits separately. Nowadays, there are three types of functional guild classifications simultaneously used in the literature: (i) the original classification proposed by Passy (O); (ii) Passy’s classification complemented with a separated planktic guild (P); (iii) the refined guild classification by Rimet and Bouchez, also containing the planktic guild (RB). One of the most important criteria of the combined functional groups is the well-defined ecological frame of these combined groups; thus it is vital to harmonise the classification of the taxa into guild based combined eco-morphological functional groups (CEMFGs). In this study we tested the similarities and dissimilarities of the correlations between environmental factors and CEMFGs created in the (i)-(iii) classifications. Samples were collected in 138 sampling sites on lowland rivers and streams in the Hungarian Lowland Region. Strong correlations were anticipated between the functional groups and environmental factors due to the presence of common and/or abundant planktic taxa. Our results validated the necessity of a separated planktic guild in ecological assessments of diatom assemblages. Further relevant differences between the correlations of CEMFGs-P or CEMFGs-RB and abiotic factors were hypothesised in the case of those functional groups which contained reassigned taxa with high frequency and/or abundance. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. Furthermore, the present study also highlighted the relevance of well-defined trait classification. Abundant and/or frequent taxa, which are able to change their life forms, can modify significantly the relationship between the functional group containing them and environmental factors. In the future, both field and laboratory studies should focus on revealing the circumstances, which cause the mentioned changes in traits of diatoms.},

   abstract = {A previously unknown member of the Bacillariaceae was discovered almost simultaneously in four different brackish coastal wetlands on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of the Iberian Peninsula. It appears to tolerate a wide range of salinities but was never common in samples where it occurred. The frustules were consistently hantzschioid ( i.e. with the raphe systems always on the same side of the frustule) and the valve outline was asymmetrical about the apical plane, two features that have until recently been considered characteristic of Hantzschia. Molecular phylogenies based on rbcL and LSU rDNA indicated, however, that the new species does not belong in Hantzschia but among the several disparate lineages that comprise the paraphyletic genus Nitzschia. This finding, coupled with the recent discovery of other diatoms with constant hantzschioid symmetry but with a morphology very similar to the type species of Nitzschia, is discussed in relation to the status and characterization of Hantzschia as an independent genus. It is concluded that, while a core of hantzschioid species may exist that can be classified together, corresponding to the traditional understanding of the genus Hantzschia, there is no single morphological feature common to all of them that can be used to diagnose the group and differentiate it from the various hantzschioid lineages that are separate from true Hantzschia and currently placed in e.g. Nitzschia or Cymbellonitzschia. Testing whether a hantzschioid species does or does not belong to Hantzschia will in many cases require molecular evidence. Although the new coastal species does not belong to the same lineage as the type species of Nitzschia, N. sigmoidea, it is described for the moment as N. varelae Carballeira, D.G. Mann & Trobajo, sp. nov., until there is a better understanding of generic limits in the Bacillariaceae following a wider molecular and morphological survey of that family.},

   abstract = {Abstract Diatoms living in intertidal sediments have to be able to rapidly adjust photosynthesis in response to often pronounced changes in light intensity during tidal cycles and changes in weather conditions. Strategies to deal with oversaturating light conditions, however, differ between growth forms. Motile epipelic diatoms can migrate to more optimal light conditions. In contrast, non-motile epipsammic diatoms appear to mainly rely on higher Non-Photochemical Quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll a fluorescence to dissipate excess light energy, and this has been related to a larger pool of xanthophyll cycle (XC) pigments. We studied the effect of 1 h high Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR) (2000 μmol photons m−2 s−1) on the kinetics of the xanthophyll cycle and NPQ in both a motile diatom (Seminavis robusta) and a non-motile diatom (Opephora guenter-grassii) in an experimental set-up which did not allow for vertical migration. O. guenter-grassii could rapidly switch NPQ on and off by relying on fast XC kinetics. This species also demonstrated high de novo synthesis of xanthophylls within a relatively short period of time (1 h), including significant amounts of zeaxanthin, a feature not observed before in other diatoms. In contrast, S. robusta showed slower NPQ and associated XC kinetics, partly relying on NPQ conferred by de novo synthetized diatoxanthin molecules and synthesis of Light-Harvesting Complex X (LHCX) isoforms. Part of this observed NPQ increase, however, is sustained quenching (NPQs). Our data illustrate the high and diverse adaptive capacity of microalgal growth forms to maximize photosynthesis in dynamic light environments.},

   abstract = {The diatom Haslea ostrearia has long been considered as the only organism able to produce a blue pigment called marennine, known for greening oysters’ gills in fattening ponds. Key factors for the triggering of this diatom’s sexual reproduction (auxosporulation) have been evidenced, such as cell concentration, light quality or light conditioning. In the aim of a European project, new species of blue diatoms have been discovered : Haslea silbo sp. nov. from the Canary Islands, Haslea karadagensis sp. nov. from the Black Sea and Haslea provincialis sp. nov. from the Mediterranean Sea. A first molecular phylogeny of the genus Haslea has been made using three markers : ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, rbcL and cox1. Blue diatoms appeared to belong to a distinct cluster inside the genus. Availability of two H. ostrearia populations from France and Sweden, sexually compatibles but bearing differences in their cox1 sequences allowed studying the distribution and inheritance of the mitochondrial DNA during auxosporulation. Moreover, UV-visible spectrophotometry and Raman spectometry have been used for pigments’ characterization. Existence of distinct pigments in the newly described species led to the proposal of a chemotaxonomic classification. Finally, biological activities of marennine and H. karadagensis’ pigments have been studied in regards of their antibacterial and antiviral properties. La diatomée Haslea ostrearia a longtemps été considérée comme le seul organisme apte à produire un pigment surnuméraire bleu nommé marennine, connu pour son rôle dans le verdissement des branchies des huîtres affinées dans les bassins ostréicoles. Certains des mécanismes et facteurs influençant l’entrée de cette diatomée en phase de reproduction sexuée (auxosporulation) ont été mis en évidence, tels la concentration cellulaire, la qualité de l’éclairement incident, ou le préconditionnement des algues. La découverte dans le cadre d’un projet européen, de populations de diatomées apparentées à H. ostrearia en divers points du globe a conduit à la description et l’identification de trois nouvelles espèces de diatomées bleues : Haslea silbo sp. nov. des îles Canaries, Haslea karadagensis sp. nov., provenant de Mer Noire et Haslea provencialis sp. nov. de Méditerranée Occidentale. La première phylogénie moléculaire de ces espèces de diatomées bleues, ainsi que d’autres espèces de diatomées appartenant au genre Haslea, a été réalisée en utilisant trois marqueurs génétiques, la cassette ribosomale ITS1-5,8S-ITS2, le gène chloroplastique rbcL ainsi qu’un fragment du gène mitochondrial cox1. Ces trois marqueurs moléculaires montrent que les diatomées bleues forment un clade distinct au sein du genre Haslea. De plus, l’existence de deux populations d’H. ostrearia originaires des côtes françaises et suédoises sexuellement compatibles a permis d’étudier la variabilité génétique intraspécifique, en mettant en évidence quelques différences au niveau de la séquence du gène cox1. Ces différences ont également permis d’étudier chez la progéniture obtenue par croisements de ces populations, la répartition et l’héritabilité de l’ADN mitochondrial. Par ailleurs, la spectophotométrie UV-visible et la spectométrie Raman ont été utilisées pour poursuivre la caractérisation physico-chimique des pigments bleus de ces diatomées. L’existence de pigments distincts chez les nouvelles espèces de diatomées bleues a permis de proposer une première classification chimiotaxonomique. Enfin, les activités biologiques de la marennine et du pigment de l’espèce ukrainienne, H. karadagensis, ont été étudiées grâce à la détermination de leurs propriétés antibactériennes et antivirales.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The question of how many marine species exist is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the first register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered. RESULTS: There are approximately 226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade ( approximately 20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are approximately 170,000 synonyms, that 58,000-72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000-741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7-1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 +/- 0.2 million marine species. On average 37% (median 31%) of species in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to science. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century.},

   abstract = {A method was established to investigate the steady state levels of mRNAs from genes encoding fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c binding proteins (Fcp) of diatoms in situ. During the study, which was performed with Wadden Sea sediments from the German North Sea shore near Dangast, oxygenic photosynthesis was carried out mainly by pennate diatoms. Field samples were taken after tidal exposure from dawn up to late afternoon at 2-hourly intervals, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. In the laboratory, total RNA was isolated by isopycnic ultracentrifugation in caesium chloride gradients. Yields of approximately 10-300 micro g RNA per gram wet sediment were obtained. Defined amounts of total RNA were blotted onto nylon membranes and hybridised with probes against the fcp2 and 18S rDNA genes of Cyclotella cryptica. To estimate the steady state amount of fcp mRNAs, fcp signal intensities were normalized to the signal intensities obtained from hybridisation to an 18S rDNA gene probe. In the two time-course studies performed to demonstrate the applicability of the method, the steady state levels of fcp mRNA increased up to 12-fold with the onset of light, reaching a maximum 6-8 h after sunrise before they decreased again. Possible reasons for this time-course are discussed.},

   abstract = {SEM and TEM observations on the cleaned material used by Hustedt for the preparation of the type of the marine diatom Cocconeis disculoides Hustedt and on living specimens of the species scraped from Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile leaves collected in different coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea revealed structures that differentiate this species from the genus Cocconeis Ehrenberg. The external apical raphe endings have marked terminal fissures; valvocopulae extend over a large part, or all, of the valve surface and bear rounded perforations arranged differently in the two bands; areolae are occluded by simple hymenes with irregularly distributed, rounded perforations. Recently, C. disculoides Hustedt was transferred to Psammococconeis Garcia, a new genus found in sediment samples from Port Belo Peninsula (Brazil), as P. disculoides (Hustedt) Garcia. However, the genus Psammococconeis lacks the raphe terminal fissures, shows two types of areolae in the sternum valve mantle and an extended valvocopula with perforations only in the raphid valve. Furthermore, in P. disculoides, the areolae are occluded by fimbriate hymenes in both valves. These observations lead us to propose the new genus Amphicocconeis, which at present includes only A. disculoides (Hustedt) comb. nov. The elements of Hustedt's type material examined by Garcia should be the lectotype of a new species of Psammococconeis.  },

   abstract = {River-dominated estuaries (also known as salt-wedge or highly stratified estuaries) are transitional water bodies occurring in micro-tidal coasts such as the Mediterranean. Their hydrological and ecological particularities make difficult the assessment of the ecological status using either the procedures for rivers or estuaries. For instance, river-dominated estuaries become rivers when the discharge is higher than its annual average (riverine conditions), whereas they become highly stratified when discharge is lower than its annual average (estuarine conditions). Moreover, the transition between riverine and estuarine conditions is abrupt and irregular across space and time, converting these transitional water bodies in naturally stressed ecosystems. To add more complexity, the human intervention in river basins (i.e. damming and intensive water use) has tended to reduce and homogenise river discharge, making more frequent and regular the presence of a salt wedge in the estuary, softening their natural stressful dynamics. As a result, it is difficult to discern natural from anthropogenic stressors, because the increase in environmental stability leads to higher complexity in biological communities and thus some bioindicators may show scores indicating better ecological status under impacted conditions than under natural conditions, which is an expression of a phenomenon known as â€˜estuarine quality paradoxâ€™. To sort out this situation and achieve a proper assessment of the ecological status of river-dominated estuaries, a specific approach is required, both in terms of the bioindicators to be used and the methodology to make them work in the correct way.},

Data publication could follow the well-established publication process: with automated quality checks, peer review, and editorial decisions. This would improve data accuracy, reduce the need for users to 'clean' the data, and might increase data use. Authors and editors would get due credit for a peer-reviewed (data) publication through use and citation metrics. Adopting standards related to data citation, accessibility, metadata, and quality control would facilitate integration of data across data sets. Here, we propose a staged publication process involving editorial and technical quality controls, of which the final (and optional) stage includes peer review, the most meritorious publication standard in science.},

   abstract = {Due to limited morphological differentiation, diatoms can be very difficult to identify and cryptic speciation is widespread. There is a need for a narrower species concept if contentious issues such as diatom biodiversities and biogeographies are to be resolved. We assessed the effectiveness of several genes (cox1, rbcL, 18S and ITS rDNA) to distinguish cryptic species within the model 'morphospecies', Sellaphora pupula agg. This is the first time that the suitability of cox1 as an identification tool for diatoms has been assessed. A range of cox1 primers was tested on Sellaphora and various outgroup taxa. Sequences were obtained for 34 isolates belonging to 22 Sellaphora taxa and three others (Pinnularia, Eunotia and Tabularia). Intraspecific divergences ranged from 0 to 5bp (=0.8%) and interspecific levels were at least 18bp (=c. 3%). Cox1 divergence was usually much greater than rbcL divergence and always much more variable than 18S rDNA. ITS rDNA sequences were more variable than cox1, but well-known problems concerning intragenomic variability caution against its use in identification. More information and less sequencing effort mean that cox1 can be a very useful aid in diatom identification. The usefulness of cox1 for determining phylogenetic relationships among Sellaphora species was also assessed and compared to rbcL. Tree topologies were very similar, although support values were generally lower for cox1.},

   abstract = {The thylakoid membrane of photoautotrophic organisms contains the main components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Detailed proteome maps of the thylakoid protein complexes of two marine diatoms, Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, were created by means of two-dimensional blue native (BN)/SDS-PAGE coupled with mass spectrometry analysis. One novel diatom-specific photosystem I (PS I)-associated protein was identified. A second plastid-targeted protein with possible PS I interaction was discovered to be restricted to the centric diatom species T. pseudonana. PGR5/PGRL homologues were found to be the only protein components of PS I-mediated cyclic electron transport common to both species. For the first time, evidence for a possible PS I localization of LI818-like light harvesting proteins (Lhcx) is presented. This study also advances the current knowledge on the light harvesting antenna composition and Lhcx expression in T. pseudonana on the protein level and presents details on the molecular distribution of Lhcx in diatoms. Above mentioned proteins and several others with unknown function provide a broad basis for further mutagenesis analysis, aiming toward further understanding of the composition and function of the photosynthetic apparatus of diatoms. The proteomics approach of this study further served as a tool to confirm and improve genome-derived protein models.},

The concatenated analysis of the sequences of the markers 18SV4, rbcL, and ITS as well as morphological data resulted in a separation of four taxa based on their biogeography in Mexico, Korea, central Continental Europe and Northern Atlantic Europe. Mantel tests showed a significant correlation between molecular and geographical distances. The diagnoses of two taxa, G. parvulum sensu stricto, and G. lagenula, were emended, G. saprophilum elevated to species rank and epitypes designated. One species was newly described.},

   abstract = {Nestedness represents the degree to which species assemblages are proper subsets of larger assemblages. Highly nested assemblages are characterized by a high number of species conforming to nested subset pattern and a low number of species which depart from nested pattern, that is, idiosyncratic species. The main aims of this paper were to (i) examine whether local stream habitat factors and spatial variables govern the number of nested stream diatom species at sites, (ii) to examine whether nested and idiosyncratic species differ in ecological characteristics, and (iii) to study if these distinctions have implications for turnover in stream diatom communities. Stream diatom communities showed a highly significant nested pattern, with observed matrix temperature of 28.4 degrees C. However, number of idiosyncratic species was high, constituting 44% of total species number of the survey. The number of nested species at sites was not related to any of the measured habitat factors or geographical location of the sampling sites. Idiosyncratic species were significantly (ANOVA: P=0.002) more widely distributed than nested species. Partial mantel tests showed that idiosyncratic species exhibited faster turnover along geographical and environmental distance than nested species. These data showed that although the degree of nestedness was highly significant, stream diatom communities were nevertheless characterized by a number of idiosyncratic species departing from the nested subset pattern. It seems that the compositional turnover is faster in communities that are dominated by idiosyncratic species suggesting that turnover diversity in diatoms may be governed more by the distribution of idiosyncratic species.},

   abstract = {The evolutionary history of diatoms is only constrained partially by the fossil record. The timing of several key events, such as initial colonization of freshwater habitats by marine taxa, remains poorly resolved. Numerous specimens of the genera Cyclotella, Discostella, and Puncticulata (Ochrophyta: Thalassiosirales) have been recovered in Middle Eocene lacustrine sediments from the Giraffe Pipe locality in the Northwest Territories, Canada. These diatoms extend the fossil record of the family Stephanodiscaceae to at least 40 million years before present (Ma) and thus provide a new evolutionary milepost for the thalassiosiroid diatoms, an important clade of centric diatoms with global representation in both marine and freshwater environments. The quality of the fossil material enables detailed investigations of areolae, fultoportulae, and rimoportulae, revealing direct morphological affinities with a number of extant taxa. These observations extend the antiquity of several characters of phylogenetic importance within the thalassiosiroid diatoms, including the fultoportula, and imply that the entire lineage is considerably older than prior constraints from the fossil record, as suggested independently by several recent molecular phylogenies.},

A review of the multi-stressors behind phytoplankton development in estuaries shows that differences in salinity tolerances and in physical processes (freshwater and particle transport, tidal amplitude, mixing processes, and in upward/downward boundaries) feature in the phytoplankton successions and magnitudes that are specific to each estuary. Nutrient loads play generally only a small role except in subtropical and tropical estuaries during periods of low discharge. The high variability of estuaries worldwide makes their monitoring difficult and the global assessment of their functioning in response to changes in climate and anthropogenic pressures stresses the need to develop online fully coupled river-estuary-coastal ocean physical- biological models at regional scales.},

   abstract = {We studied particle selection in the ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa, an important suspension-feeding inhabitant of estuaries and intertidal zones of salt marshes along the Atlantic coast of North America. Adult mussels were fed on several mixtures of microalgal cultures (1) in exponential or (2) in stationary phase of growth, and the proportional occurrence of algal species in pseudofeces was examined by flow cytometry. The Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, was chosen as a reference. Results showed that both mussels and oysters were able to selectively ingest or reject our experimental microalgae. Moreover, the pre-ingestive particle selection was affected by microalgal growth phase, particularly in mussels. For instance, the sorting efficiency index increased significantly in mussels fed with a blend made of Nitzschia closterium, Isochrysis sp. and Tetraselmis suesica harvested in stationary growth phase, as compared to the same blend made with microalgae in exponential growth phase. Isochrysis sp. and T suesica were preferentially ingested by both bivalves whereas N. closterium, was preferentially rejected in pseudofeces. These results demonstrate particle selection in ribbed mussel and underline the effect of algae growth phase on the sorting mechanisms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lubarsky2010,
   abstract = {It is recognized that microorganisms inhabiting natural sediments significantly mediate the erosive response of the bed ("ecosystem engineers") through the secretion of naturally adhesive organic material (EPS: extracellular polymeric substances). However, little is known about the individual engineering capability of the main biofilm components (heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic microalgae) in terms of their individual contribution to the EPS pool and their relative functional contribution to substratum stabilisation. This paper investigates the engineering effects on a non-cohesive test bed as the surface was colonised by natural benthic assemblages (prokaryotic, eukaryotic and mixed cultures) of bacteria and microalgae. MagPI (Magnetic Particle Induction) and CSM (Cohesive Strength Meter) respectively determined the adhesive capacity and the cohesive strength of the culture surface. Stabilisation was significantly higher for the bacterial assemblages (up to a factor of 2) than for axenic microalgal assemblages. The EPS concentration and the EPS composition (carbohydrates and proteins) were both important in determining stabilisation. The peak of engineering effect was significantly greater in the mixed assemblage as compared to the bacterial (x 1.2) and axenic diatom (x 1.7) cultures. The possibility of synergistic effects between the bacterial and algal cultures in terms of stability was examined and rejected although the concentration of EPS did show a synergistic elevation in mixed culture. The rapid development and overall stabilisation potential of the various assemblages was impressive (x 7.5 and x9.5, for MagPI and CSM, respectively, as compared to controls). We confirmed the important role of heterotrophic bacteria in "biostabilisation" and highlighted the interactions between autotrophic and heterotrophic biofilm consortia. This information contributes to the conceptual understanding of the microbial sediment engineering that represents an important ecosystem function and service in aquatic habitats.},

   abstract = {We used morphological and molecular approaches to evaluate the diversity of free-living marine nematodes (order Enoplida) at four coastal sites in the Gulf of California and three on the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico. We identified 22 morphological species belonging to six families, of which Thoracostomopsidae and Oncholaimidae were the most diverse. The genus Mesacanthion (Thoracostomopsidae) was the most widespread and diverse. Five allopatric species, genetically and morphologically differentiated, were found in two localities in the Gulf of California (M. sp1 and M. sp2) and three in the Pacific coast (M. sp3, M. sp4 and M. sp5). Overall, we produced 19 and 20 sequences for the 18S and 28S genes, respectively. Neither gene displayed intraspecific polymorphisms, which allowed us to establish that some morphological variation was likely either ontogenetic or due to phenotypic plasticity. Although 18S and 28S phylogenies were topologically congruent (incongruence length difference test, P > 0.05), divergences between species were much higher in the 28S gene. Moreover, this gene possessed a stronger phylogenetic signal to resolve relationships involving Rhabdodemania and Bathylaimus. On the other hand, the close relationship of Pareurystomina (Enchilidiidae) with oncholaimids warrants further study. The 28S sequences (D2D3 domain) may be better suited for DNA barcoding of marine nematodes than those from the 18S rDNA, particularly for differentiating closely related or cryptic species. Finally, our results underline the relevance of adopting an integrative approach encompassing morphological and molecular analyses to improve the assessment of marine nematode diversity and advance their taxonomy.},

   abstract = {Imaging pulse amplitude modulated (Imaging-PAM) fluorometry is a breakthrough in the study of spatial heterogeneity of photosynthetic assemblages. However, Imaging and conventional PAM uses a different technology, making comparisons between these techniques doubtful. Thereby, photosynthetic processes were comparatively assessed using conventional (Junior PAM and PAM 101) and Imaging-PAM on intertidal microphytobenthos (MPB; mud and sand) and on cork oak leaves. Lower values of alpha (initial slope of the rETR, relative photosynthetic electron transport rate) vs E (incident photosynthetic active radiation) curve), ETR(max) (maximum relative ETR), E(k) (light saturation parameter) and F(v)/F(m) (maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II of dark-adapted samples) were obtained using the Imaging-PAM. The level of discrepancy between conventional and Imaging-PAM systems was dependent on the type of sample, being more pronounced for MPB muddy sediments. This may be explained by differences in the depth integration of the fluorescence signal related to the thickness of the photosynthetic layer and in the light attenuation coefficients of downwelling irradiance. An additional relevant parameter is the taxonomic composition of the MPB, as cyanobacteria present in sandy sediments rendered different results with red and blue excitation light fluorometers. These findings emphasize the caution needed when interpreting chlorophyll fluorescence data of MPB communities.},

   abstract = {Climate warming has been linked to an apparent general decrease in body sizes of ectotherms, both across and within taxa, especially in aquatic systems. Smaller body size in warmer geographical regions has also been widely observed. Since body size is a fundamental determinant of many biological attributes, climate-warming-related changes in size could ripple across multiple levels of ecological organization. Some recent studies have questioned the ubiquity of temperature-size rules, however, and certain widespread and abundant taxa, such as diatoms, may be important exceptions. We tested the hypothesis that diatoms are smaller at warmer temperatures using a system of geothermally heated streams. There was no consistent relationship between size and temperature at either the population or community level. These field data provide important counterexamples to both James' and Bergmann's temperature-size rules, respectively, undermining the widely held assumption that warming favours the small. This study provides compelling new evidence that diatoms are an important exception to temperature-size rules for three reasons: (i) we use many more species than prior work; (ii) we examine both community and species levels of organization simultaneously; (iii) we work in a natural system with a wide temperature gradient but minimal variation in other factors, to achieve robust tests of hypotheses without relying on laboratory setups, which have limited realism. In addition, we show that interspecific effects were a bigger contributor to whole-community size differences, and are probably more ecologically important than more commonly studied intraspecific effects. These findings highlight the need for multispecies approaches in future studies of climate warming and body size.},

   abstract = {Over the past several decades, a rapidly expanding field of research known as biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has begun to quantify how the world's biological diversity can, as an independent variable, control ecological processes that are both essential for, and fundamental to, the functioning of ecosystems. Research in this area has often been justified on grounds that (1) loss of biological diversity ranks among the most pronounced changes to the global environment and that (2) reductions in diversity, and corresponding changes in species composition, could alter important services that ecosystems provide to humanity (e.g., food production, pest/disease control, water purification). Here we review over two decades of experiments that have examined how species richness of primary producers influences the suite of ecological processes that are controlled by plants and algae in terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. Using formal meta-analyses, we assess the balance of evidence for eight fundamental questions and corresponding hypotheses about the functional role of producer diversity in ecosystems. These include questions about how primary producer diversity influences the efficiency of resource use and biomass production in ecosystems, how primary producer diversity influences the transfer and recycling of biomass to other trophic groups in a food web, and the number of species and spatial /temporal scales at which diversity effects are most apparent. After summarizing the balance of evidence and stating our own confidence in the conclusions, we outline several new questions that must now be addressed if this field is going to evolve into a predictive science that can help conserve and manage ecological processes in ecosystems.},

All species grew well over at least the range of 10 to 30; several species grew well over the entire salinity range. At 20 the division rate was either maximal or close to maximal. Diatoms preconditioned to particular salinities in general divided at the same rate as those not preconditioned. Maximum rates for the 14 species ranged from 0.6 to 3.2 divisionslday. These maximum rates had highly significant correlations with both the logarithm of the cell volume and the square root of cell areatcell volume. Least squares regressions were computed for these relationships with volume expressed in µ3 and area in µ2.},

   abstract = {To investigate the effect of bacteria on diatoms at the community level, sediment samples from an intertidal tropical environment were treated with penicillin (a beta-lactam antibiotic that can affect diatoms only through bacteria). Streptomycin (an aminoglycoside) and chloramphenicol, antibiotics that can potentially affect protein synthesis in diatom organelles and photosynthesis, were also used for comparison. The changes in diatom community structure and the resistant and tolerant bacterial fractions were analyzed through microscopy, culture techniques and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The reduction in bacterial abundance when treated with penicillin resulted in suppression of Amphora coffeaeformis, a dominant diatom in the study area. The bacterial community preferred the 'tolerance' strategy over 'resistance' in response to treatment with penicillin; these changes in bacterial dynamics were probably linked to concurrent changes in diatom community structure. The observations with penicillin differed from those with streptomycin that did not seem to significantly affect diatoms, and chloramphenicol, which consistently inhibited diatoms. Overall, the results of this study highlight the significance of bacteria in structuring benthic diatom communities and call for the inclusion of the 'antibiotics' approach in studies addressing diatom-bacterial interactions at the community level.},

   abstract = {High-resolution LM images of diatoms from remote regions of western Canada are presented as a contribution to our knowledge of diatom floristics, ecology and biogeography in North America. Approximately 600 taxa are imaged in 132 plates. Genera with the most taxa are Cymbella (19 taxa), Cymbopleura (29), Encyonema (23), Encyonopsis (15), Eunotia (77), Gomphonema (42), Navicula (47), Neidium (20), Nitzschia (35), Pinnularia (50) and Stauroneis (34). Diatoms were collected from diverse habitats in four of North America's major biomes: Arctic tundra, taiga, Rocky Mountains and Pacific rainforest. Many of the photographed taxa could not be identified to species and are likely new to science. Other taxa may represent new records for North America or Canada. Images of voucher specimens are keyed to individual collection sites. Detailed descriptions of the collection sites include GPS coordinates, colour photographs, vegetation, algal substrates, elevations, pH, temperature and conductivity. Samples were collected from natural substrates in fresh to brackish, flowing and standing waters. Voucher slides are deposited in the Montana Diatom Collection (Helena) and the University of Montana Herbarium (Missoula). Cleaned diatom frustules have been deposited in the Diatom Herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.},

   abstract = {The structure of microplankton populations sampled in the Gulf of Marseilles during 1964 has been estimated by means of various diversity measurements. Numerical results and chlorophyll a concentrations have been used to describe the seasonal cycle and vertical distribution of microplankton at two stations. Data are also given upon species composition and ecological succession. A comparison is made between different species diversity indices applied to microplankton of the Gulf of Marseilles. Annual fluctuations in species diversity of the plankton are described, together with its relationship with ecological succession. Dominance, redundancy and equitability estimates of the relative species frequencies are compared with each other and with total species diversity measurements. These estimates have been applied to the study of marine microplankton structure and evolution. Structure and evolution have been graphically represented by means of frequency diagrams, which appear promising. Finally, phytoplankton pigment diversity has been taken and compared with species diversity. As a result, the use of indices derived from the information theory ( $$\bar D$$ or $$\bar D\prime $$ on the one hand, R or J on the other hand) is recommended. A simple index such as the Gleason-Margalef species diversity index d can also be profitably used (especially if improved by the Sanders rare-faction faction method). Use of the pigment diversity index, however, calls for more caution. The use of frequency diagrams permits a more detailed description and a better interpretation of the evolution of the ecosystem structure and of ecological succession.},

   abstract = {Rapid light-response curves (RLC) of variable chlorophyll fluorescence were measured on estuarine benthic microalgae with the purpose of characterising its response to changes in ambient light, and of investigating the relationship to steady-state light-response curves (LC). The response of RLCs to changes in ambient light (E, defined as the irradiance level to which a sample is acclimated to prior to the start of the RLC) was characterised by constructing light-response curves for the RLC parameters alpha (RLC), the initial slope, ETR(m,RLC), the maximum relative electron transport rate, and E (k,RLC), the light-saturation parameter. Measurements were carried out on diatom-dominated suspensions of benthic microalgae and RLC and LC parameters were compared for a wide range of ambient light conditions, time of day, season and sample taxonomic composition. The photoresponse of RLC parameters was typically bi-phasic, consisting of an initial increase of all parameters under low ambient light (E < 21-181 micromol m(-2) s(-1)), and of a phase during which alpha (RLC) decreased significantly with E, and the increase of ETR(m,RLC) and E (k,RLC) was attenuated. The relationship between RLC and LC parameters was dependent on ambient irradiance, with significant correlations being found between alpha (RLC) and alpha, and between ETR(m,RLC) and ETR(m), for samples acclimated to low and to high ambient irradiances, respectively. The decline of alpha (RLC) under high light (Deltaalpha (RLC)) was strongly correlated (P < 0.001 in all cases) with the level of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) measured before each RLC. These results indicate the possibility of using RLCs to characterise the steady-state photoacclimation status of a sample, by estimating the LC parameter E (k), and to trace short-term changes in NPQ levels without dark incubation.},

   abstract = {Diatom-dominated microphytobenthos (MPB) is the main primary producer of many intertidal and shallow subtidal environments, being therefore of critical importance to estuarine and coastal food webs. Owing to tidal cycles, intertidal MPB diatoms are subjected to environmental conditions far more variable than the ones experienced by pelagic diatoms (e.g. light, temperature, salinity, desiccation and nutrient availability). Nevertheless, benthic diatoms evolved adaptation mechanisms to these harsh conditions, including the capacity to move within steep physical and chemical gradients, allowing them to perform photosynthesis efficiently. In this contribution, we will review present knowledge on the effects of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) availability on photosynthesis and productivity of diatom-dominated MPB. We present evidence of carbon limitation of photosynthesis in benthic diatom mats and highly productive MPB natural communities. Furthermore, we hypothesize that active vertical migration of epipelic motile diatoms could overcome local depletion of DIC in the photic layer, providing the cells alternately with light and inorganic carbon supply. The few available longer-term experiments on the effects of inorganic carbon enrichment on the productivity of diatom-dominated MPB have yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, further studies are needed to properly assess the response of MPB communities to increased CO2 and ocean acidification related to climate change.This article is part of the themed issue 'The peculiar carbon metabolism in diatoms'.},

   abstract = {Estuarine soft sediments support a diverse group of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms though the role of the sediment per se for the functioning of these organisms remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to test the effect of sediment grain size on the grazing activities of harpacticoid copepods. In controlled experiments, two common intertidal harpacticoid species (Paramphiascella fulvofasciata and Nitokra spinipes) were each offered a mix of two benthic diatom species (Navicula phyllepta and Seminavis robusta) in different sedimentary conditions. Several microcosms were created using a variety of sediment types, including fine silt (<63 microm), coarser grained sands (125-250, 250-450, 100-300 microm), artificial 'sediments' of glass beads (250-500, 2000 microm) and even the absence of sediment was tested. The diatoms were enriched in the stable carbon (13)C to facilitate tracing in the harpacticoids. Both copepod species were able to graze on the diatoms with highest uptake when sediment was absent. In contrast, both harpacticoid species showed no uptake in silty conditions. In general, grazing was favoured when mean sediment grain size increased. The strong negative effect of fine grains on the grazer's efficiency can be explained by the resulting differences in the structure (and accessibility) of the diatom biofilm on the one hand and the mobility of the grazer on the other hand. In view of the subtle equilibrium between primary producers and grazers, these results might have important implications for the effect of siltation of tidal flats due to, e.g., human activities.},

   abstract = {The role of habitat complexity has been widely neglected in the study of meiofaunal community patterns. We studied the intertidal nematode community of a structurally complex macrotidal beach exhibiting contrasting microhabitats (sandbars and runnels) to understand the influence of environmental gradients and habitat heterogeneity in the community structure. We tested whether topographical complexity affected (1) the zonation pattern in terms of abundance and diversity, and (2) local diversity by promoting compartmentalization into distinct faunal groups. Our analyses revealed three major faunal assemblages along the exposure gradient associated to differences in mean grain size and chlorophyll a. Diversity patterns involved a mid-intertidal peak, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and another peak at the limit with the subtidal region, consistent with the transition zone. These results highlight the predominance of environmental gradients in establishing intertidal zonation. However, microhabitats differed in environmental conditions and possessed significantly distinct nematofaunal communities. Runnels featured higher levels of taxonomic and functional diversity, many unique genera, and the community differed from the assemblage at the limit to the subtidal, stressing their role as distinct microhabitats. The nematofauna of the structurally complex beach was more diverse than the one from a homogeneous beach nearby, supporting the hypothesis that structural heterogeneity promotes diversity by compartmentalization and highlighting the importance of microhabitats in the assessment of biodiversity. Contrary to previous predictions, our results indicate potentially high regional marine nematode diversity in the Upper Gulf of California.},

   abstract = {DNA barcoding uses a short fragment of a DNA sequence to identify a taxon. After obtaining the target sequence it is compared to reference sequences stored in a database to assign an organism name to it. The quality of data in the reference database is the key to the success of the analysis. In the here presented study, multiple types of data have been combined and critically examined in order to create best practice guidelines for taxonomic reference libraries for environmental barcoding. 70 unialgal diatom strains from Berlin waters have been established and cultured to obtain morphological and molecular data. The strains were sequenced for 18S V4 rDNA (the pre-Barcode for protists) as well as rbcL data, and identified by microscopy. LM and for some strains also SEM pictures were taken and physical vouchers deposited at the BGBM. 37 freshwater taxa from 15 naviculoid diatom genera were identified. Four taxa from the genera Amphora, Mayamaea, Planothidium and Stauroneis are described here as new. Names, molecular, morphological and habitat data as well as additional images of living cells are also available electronically in the AlgaTerra Information System. All reference sequences (or reference barcodes) presented here are linked to voucher specimens in order to provide a complete chain of evidence back to the formal taxonomic literature.},

   abstract = {Assessments of temporal variation in stable carbon and nitrogen ratios were used to examine seasonal trends of the water column and benthic food webs in the Mondego estuary (Portugal). There was a marked seasonality in weather and water column conditions, including nutrient supply and chlorophyll concentrations. In spite of the pronounced environmental changes, we found little evidence of seasonal variation in delta(13)C and delta(15)N of producers and consumers in the Mondego estuary, with a few notable exceptions. Nitrogen isotope ratios in macrophytes (Zostera noltii, Ulva sp., Enteromorpha sp., and Gracilaria sp.), and in two grazers (Idotea chelipes and Lekanesphaera levii) increased during late summer, with the highest delta(15)N values being measured in July, during a period of elevated temperatures and drought, which may have favored high rates of denitrification and heavier delta(15)N values. The results suggest that stable-isotope values from macrophytes and selected grazers are useful as tracers of seasonal changes in nitrogen inputs into estuaries, and that those of consumers reflect other factors beyond seasonal variations in N and C sources.},

   abstract = {Adhesion of raphid diatoms to surfaces, mediated by the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), is an important strategy for growth and survival. Diatom biofilms are also important in the context of biofouling. Diatoms exhibit selectivity in adhering to surfaces, but little is understood about how they perceive the properties of a substratum and translate that perception into altered adhesion properties. In this study, we demonstrate that Seminavis robusta Danielidis et D. G. Mann, like many other pennate diatoms, adheres more strongly to hydrophobic surfaces (such as silicone elastomer foul-release coatings) than to hydrophilic surfaces. To explore the cellular mechanisms that may underlie this selectivity, we tested the hypothesis that diatoms may perceive a hydrophilic surface as unconducive to adhesion through a form of stress response involving nitric oxide (NO) production. Single-cell imaging with the fluorescent indicator DAF-FM DA (4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate), revealed NO levels that were 4-fold higher in cells adhered to a hydrophilic surface (acid-washed glass) compared with a hydrophobic surface (polydimethylsiloxane elastomer, PDMSE). Elevated levels of NO caused by the addition of the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) did not affect growth, but cells showed reduced adhesion strength to both glass and PDMSE. Addition of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (NMMA) caused a small but significant increase in adhesion strength. Overall, the results suggest that NO acts as a signal of the wettability properties of substrata for Seminavis.},

We address the question of what GEnS entails especially with regard to the level at which targets are set (descriptors, criteria, indicators), to scales for assessments (regional, sub-divisions, site-specific), and to difficulties in putting into practice the GEnS concept. We propose a refined and operational definition of GEnS, indicating the data and information needed to all parts of that definition. We indicate the options for determining when GEnS has been met, acknowledge the data and information needs for each option, and recommend a combination of existing quantitative targets and expert judgement. We think that the MSFD implementation needs to be less complex than shown for other similar directives, can be based largely on existing data and can be centred on the activities of the Regional Seas Conventions.},

FBs in the ear, nose, and throat are a common problem frequently encountered in both children and adults. Objective To analyze FBs in terms of type, site, age, and gender distribution and method of removal. Methods A retrospective study was performed in a tertiary care hospital in the central part of Nepal. The study period was from June 2013 to May 2014. The information was obtained from hospital record books. Results A total of 134 patients had FBs in the ear, nose, or throat; 94 were males and 40 were females. Of the 134 patients, 70 (52.23%) had FB in the ear, 28 (20.89%) in the nose, and 36 (26.86%) in the throat. The FB was animate (living) in 28 (40%) patients with FB in the ear and 1 (3.5%) patient with FB in the nose, but the FB was inanimate (nonliving) in any patient with FB in the throat, in 42 (60%) patients with FB in the ear FB, and in 27 (96.4%) patients with FB of the nose. The FB was removed with or without local anaesthesia (LA) in 98 (73.13%) patients, and only 36 patients (26.86%) required general anaesthesia (GA). The most common age group affected was <10 years. Conclusion FBs in the ear and nose were found more frequently in children, and the throat was the most common site of FB in adults and elderly people. Most of the FBs can be easily removed in emergency room or outpatient department.},

The high local diversity results in "flat" species-area curves of individual protist groups. We investigated the local and regional diversity of the genus Mallomonas in the alluvial plain of upper Luznice in the Czech Republic. About 86.5% of species previously reported from all types of freshwater biotopes within the country were found in our investigated localities. However, there was a considerable increase of species numbers in relation to the total area of available habitats on the continent and global scales. In three species found in our localities, the floristic data indicate a possible geographically restricted distributional pattern. Here, we discuss possible reasons for this phenomenon.},

   abstract = {The present study explores the use of stable carbon isotopes to trace organic matter sources of intertidal nematodes in the Schelde estuary (SW Netherlands). Stable carbon isotope signatures of nematodes from a saltmarsh and 4 tidal flat stations were determined in spring and winter situations, and compared to isotope ratios of organic matter sources within the estuary. Nematodes collected from fine sandy tidal flat sediments in late spring and during mild and sunny late winter weather had δ13C values consistent with microphytobenthos as their prime carbon source. Nematodesfrom a silty station and individuals sampled under cold and dark winter conditions had δ13Cvalues intermediate between those of microalgae and particulate organic matter. The isotopic signaturesof nematodes from the saltmarsh station were intermediate between those of microalgae,Spartina anglica-litter and particulate organic matter. An in situ H13CO3 – spike experiment at 2 tidal flat stations corroborated the importance of microphytobenthos as a carbon source for nematodes, yet at the same time contradicted the hypothesis that direct grazing would be the main pathway of microalgal carbon to nematode consumers. A laboratory experiment adding 13C-labeled algal detritus to sediment microcosms demonstrated the nematodes’ ability to rapidly utilize settling organic matter too. Incorporation of carbon from phytodetritus by subsurface nematodes in both enrichment experiments was high, but, compared to carbon utilization by surface individuals, showed time-lags largely consistent with sediment mixing rates. A combination of observed natural isotope signatures and experimental results suggests that tidal flat nematodes preferentially utilize labile organic carbon derived from microphytobenthos or settling phytoplankton; organic matter from terrestrial or riverine origin does not contribute significantly to the diet of nematodes at our study sites.},

   abstract = {Although estuarine microphytobenthos (MPB) is frequently exposed to excessive light and temperature conditions, little is known on their interactive effects on MPB primary productivity. Laboratory and in situ experiments were combined to investigate the short-term joint effects of high light (HL) and high temperature (37 degrees C versus 27 degrees C) on the operating efficiency of photoprotective processes [vertical migration versus non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)] exhibited by natural benthic diatom communities from two intertidal flats in France (FR) and Portugal (PT). A clear latitudinal pattern was observed, with PT biofilms being more resistant to HL stress, regardless the effect of temperature, and displaying a lower relative contribution of vertical migration to photoprotection and a stronger NPQ in situ. However, higher temperature leads to comparable effects, with photoinhibition increasing to about three times (i.e. from 3% to 10% and from 8% to 22% in PT and FR sites respectively). By using a number of methodological novelties in MPB research (lipid peroxidation quantification, Lhcx proteins immunodetection), this study brings a physiological basis to the previously reported depression of MPB photosynthetic productivity in summer. They emphasize the joint role of temperature and light in limiting, at least transiently (i.e. during emersion), MPB photosynthetic activity in situ.},

   abstract = {The evolutionary causes for generation of nano and microstructured silica by photosynthetic algae are not yet deciphered. Diatoms are single photosynthetic algal cells populating the oceans and waters around the globe. They generate a considerable fraction (20-30%) of all oxygen from photosynthesis, and 45% of total primary production of organic material in the sea. There are more than 100,000 species of diatoms, classified by the shape of the glass cage in which they live, and which they build during algal growth. These glass structures have accumulated for the last 100 million of years, and left rich deposits of nano/microstructured silicon oxide in the form of diatomaceous earth around the globe. Here we show that reflection of ultraviolet light by nanostructured silica can protect the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the algal cells, and that this may be an evolutionary cause for the formation of glass cages.},

   abstract = {A general framework for automatic segmentation of diatom images is presented. This segmentation is a critical first step in contour-based methods for automatic identification of diatoms by computerized image analysis. We review existing results, adapt popular segmentation methods to this difficult problem, and finally develop a method that substantially improves existing results. This method is based on the watershed segmentation from mathematical morphology, and belongs to the class of hybrid segmentation techniques. The novelty of the method is the use of connected operators for the computation and selection of markers, a critical ingredient in the watershed method to avoid over-segmentation. All methods considered were used to extract binary contours from a large database of diatom images, and the quality of the contours was evaluated both visually and based on identification performance.},

   abstract = {Abundance and composition of microplankton were studied over a period of 2 years at two depths in Villefranche Bay (Ligurian Sea, NW Mediterranean Sea). Diatoms dominated the microplankton in late spring and autumn, whereas dinoflagellates composed the major part of the microplankton in summer. The silicoflagellate Dictyocha fibula and the diatom Thalassionema frauenfeldii dominated in winter. Ciliates showed low variability throughout the year with the lowest abundance in February and an increase which coincided with the diatom maxima during autumn in both years. In 1998, the spring bloom (in May) was mainly composed of dinoflagellates near the surface and of diatoms in deeper layers. Subsurface diatom maxima were observed in August–September and November. In 1999, diatoms peaked in May both at the surface and at the depth of 50 m. They showed a strong maximum in October. Dinoflagellates and tintinnids showed maxima in early November. Comparisons with previous studies reveal that (i) changes in species composition have not been significant, (ii) the silicoflagellate’s abundance is lower during the present study, (iii) the sequential spring bloom is composed of a pico-nanoplankton bloom in March and microphytoplankton in May, whereas in other western Mediterranean areas the spring microphytoplankton bloom is reported in February and March, (iv) high water transport through the Corsica channel coinciding with low or negative winter values of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index are associated with the anomalous strong development of the spring diatom blooms in the Bay of Villefranche, whereas the usual trend is the lack of or weak development of the spring diatom bloom. This feature may determine the nature and the fate of primary production and the interannual variability in the relative importance of the microbial food web versus the microbial loop.},

   abstract = {High productivity in intertidal microphytobenthic communities is achieved despite exposure to extreme and dynamic conditions (e.g. light, salinity, temperature). As an adaptation to this hostile environment, most of the microalgae species inhabiting fine-sediment habitats are motile, being able to migrate vertically within the uppermost layers of the sediment and actively regulating their exposure to light. In this work we tested the hypothesis that the migratory photobehaviour of benthic diatoms, the dominant group in microphytobenthic assemblages, is conditioned by their photophysiological state (i.e. photoacclimation). Unialgal cultures of the motile diatom Navicula cf. recens were grown under contrasting light regimes (20 and 300μmolquantam-2s-1) to induce different photoacclimation states. The migratory response to light was characterized by studying the distribution of motile cells along a light gradient (photoaccumulation curve), using a custom-build photoaccumulation chamber. The photoaccumulation curves were constructed by measuring the accumulation of cells along the light gradient using a light transmission index. The variation of the photophysiological state of the cells along the light gradient was measured using Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorometry (maximum quantum yield and light response curves of the relative electron transport rate of photosystem II). The results showed clearly different photoaccumulation curves for low and high-light acclimated cells. Although in both cases, cells avoided extreme low and high light levels, maximum cell accumulation was reached at markedly different light intensities depending on growth light conditions and resulting photoacclimation state: 72 and 104μmolquantam-2s-1 for the low and high light-acclimated cells, respectively. Strong relationships were found between photophysiological parameters characterizing photoacclimation or susceptibility to photoinhibition and migratory light response, supporting that this diatom uses motility to select the optimal light exposure according to its photophysiological preferences. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg), is the main bivalve species cultivated in the world. With global warming enabling its reproduction and larval survival at higher latitudes, this species is now recognized as invasive and creates wild oyster reefs globally. In this study, the spatial distribution of photosynthetic assemblages colonizing the shells of wild C. gigas was investigated on both a large scale (two contrasting types of reefs found in mudflats and rocky areas) and a small scale (within individual shells) using a hyperspectral imager. The microspatial distribution of all phototrophs was obtained by mapping the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Second derivative (delta delta) analyses of hyperspectral images at 462, 524, 571 and 647 nm were subsequently applied to map diatoms, cyanobacteria, rhodophytes and chlorophytes, respectively. A concomitant pigment analysis was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography and completed by taxonomic observations. This study showed that there was high microalgal diversity associated with wild oyster shells and that there were differences in the structure of the phototropic assemblages depending on the type of reef. Namely, vertically-growing oysters in mudflat areas had a higher biomass of epizoic diatoms (hyperspectral proxy at delta(462) nm) and were mainly colonized by species of the genera Navicula, Nitzschia and Hippodonta, which are epipelic or motile epipsammic. The assemblages on the horizontal oysters contained more tychoplanktonic diatoms (e.g. Thalassiosira pseudonana, T. proschkinae and Plagiogrammopsis vanheurckii). Three species of boring cyanobacteria were observed for both types of reef: Mastigocoleus testarum, Leptolyngbya terrebrans, and Hyella caespistosa, but the second derivative analysis at 524 nm showed a significantly higher biomass for the horizontally-growing oysters. There was no biomass difference for the boring chlorophyte assemblages (delta delta(647) nm), with two species: Eugomontia testarum and Ostreobium quekettii observed for both types of reef. This study shows that oyster shells are an idiosyncratic but ubiquitous habitat for phototrophic assemblages. The contribution of these assemblages in terms of},

Some of the old lists and descriptions are unknown or have been ignored by Brazilian researchers and the situation of the names cited was not assessed. Here we compiled a list of 101 taxa of diatoms from Brazil registered by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg during the 19(th) century. We checked the current nomenclatural status of those taxa and lectotypified species from Brazil described by this author. For this, we accessed the Ehrenberg collection in the Museum fur Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany, where 11 samples from Brazil studied by Ehrenberg are housed and published in different papers. Using these samples, we found 101 taxa (specific and infraspecific) published by Ehrenberg from Brazil. Five species (Eunotia bidens Ehrenb., Eunotia depressa Ehrenb., Eunotia elephas Ehrenb., Pinnularia microstauron Ehrenb., and Terpsinoe brasiliensis Ehrenb.) were new descriptions and were lectotypified here. The other species cited for Brazil were described initially from other places. However, 23 names were invalid and one illegitimate.},

   abstract = {A recent increase in studies of beta diversity has yielded a confusing array of concepts, measures and methods. Here, we provide a roadmap of the most widely used and ecologically relevant approaches for analysis through a series of mission statements. We distinguish two types of beta diversity: directional turnover along a gradient vs. non-directional variation. Different measures emphasize different properties of ecological data. Such properties include the degree of emphasis on presence/absence vs. relative abundance information and the inclusion vs. exclusion of joint absences. Judicious use of multiple measures in concert can uncover the underlying nature of patterns in beta diversity for a given dataset. A case study of Indonesian coral assemblages shows the utility of a multi-faceted approach. We advocate careful consideration of relevant questions, matched by appropriate analyses. The rigorous application of null models will also help to reveal potential processes driving observed patterns in beta diversity.},

   abstract = {Marine eukaryotic photosynthesis is dominated by a diverse group of unicellular organisms collectively called microalgae. Microalgae include cells derived from a primary endosymbiotic event (similar to land plants) and cells derived from subsequent secondary and/or tertiary endosymbiotic events. These latter cells are chimeras of several genomes and dominate primary production in the marine environment. Two consequences of multiple endosymbiotic events include complex targeting mechanisms to allow nuclear-encoded proteins to be imported into the plastid and coordination of enzymes, potentially from disparate originator cells, to form complete metabolic pathways. In this review, we discuss the forces that shaped the genomes of marine microalgae and then discuss some of the metabolic consequences of such a complex evolutionary history. We focus our metabolic discussion on carbon, nitrogen, and iron. We then discuss biomineralization and new evidence for programmed cell death in microalgae. We conclude with a short summary on advances in genetic manipulation of microalgae and thoughts on the future directions of marine algal genomics.},

   abstract = {Abstract The use of trait-based approaches to detect effects of land use and climate change on terrestrial plant and aquatic phytoplankton communities is increasing, but such a framework is still needed for benthic stream algae. Here we present a conceptual framework of morphological, physiological, behavioural and life-history traits relating to resource acquisition and resistance to disturbance. We tested this approach by assessing the relationships between multiple anthropogenic stressors and algal traits at 43 stream sites. Our “natural experiment” was conducted along gradients of agricultural land-use intensity (0–95% of the catchment in high-producing pasture) and hydrological alteration (0–92% streamflow reduction resulting from water abstraction for irrigation) as well as related physicochemical variables (total nitrogen concentration and deposited fine sediment). Strategic choice of study sites meant that agricultural intensity and hydrological alteration were uncorrelated. We studied the relationships of seven traits (with 23 trait categories) to our environmental predictor variables using general linear models and an information-theoretic model-selection approach. Life form, nitrogen fixation and spore formation were key traits that showed the strongest relationships with environmental stressors. Overall, FI (farming intensity) exerted stronger effects on algal communities than hydrological alteration. The large-bodied, non-attached, filamentous algae that dominated under high farming intensities have limited dispersal abilities but may cope with unfavourable conditions through the formation of spores. Antagonistic interactions between FI and flow reduction were observed for some trait variables, whereas no interactions occurred for nitrogen concentration and fine sediment. Our conceptual framework was well supported by tests of ten specific hypotheses predicting effects of resource supply and disturbance on algal traits. Our study also shows that investigating a fairly comprehensive set of traits can help shed light on the drivers of algal community composition in situations where multiple stressors are operating. Further, to understand non-linear and non-additive effects of such drivers, communities need to be studied along multiple gradients of natural variation or anthropogenic stressors.},

One aspect of these is the presence, in transitional waters particularly, of large blooms of opportunistic macroalgae, such as Ulva and Enteromorpha. Within the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland (RoI) there are currently no set ecological quality objectives or standards for macroalgae. Nor are there standard methods for monitoring macroalgal blooms, although various combinations of aerial photography, remote sensing and measurements on the ground are used. This paper attempts to set a logical framework for the prioritisation of sites for monitoring, the development of a tiered monitoring procedure and the derivation of thresholds for classification. Draft threshold limits for percentage cover and biomass of macroalgae have been derived from the literature. The importance of secondary effects and physico-chemical parameters is discussed.},

   abstract = {Avoidance response is a well-known mechanism for escaping environmental stress. For organisms with reduced active movement, such as benthic microalgae, drifting could be a specifically selected mean of avoiding less favorable environments. To test this hypothesis, a system was developed to assess if hypo-saline stress triggers drift in the estuarine benthic diatom Cylindrotheca closterium. Concurrently, the effects of salinity on growth inhibition were also investigated in order to compare the sensitivity of this endpoint with the drift response, and to estimate the immediate population decline caused by both drift and population growth responses. It was verified that the salinity value that inhibited the algal population growth by 50% (IGS50) was 19, while the salinity value that triggered the drift response by 50% of the population (TDS50) was 15. These results indicate that drift is an identifiable response triggered to escape stressful environments. The combination of the two responses (population growth and drift) showed that population decline based exclusively on the inhibition of population growth may result in an underestimation of the risk, compared with the decline when drifting to avoid stress is also taken into account.},

   abstract = {The quantitative importance and composition of protozoan communities was investigated in sandy and silty intertidal sediments of a polyhaline and a freshwater site in the Schelde estuary. Total biomass of the protozoans studied, integrated over the upper 4 cm of the sediment, ranged from 41 to 597 mg C m(-2) and was in the same order of magnitude at the polyhaline and the freshwater intertidal site. Nanoheterotrophs were the dominant protozoans, in terms of both abundance and biomass. Ciliate abundances appeared to be largely determined by physical constraints, namely, the amount of interstitial space and hydrodynamic disturbances. It remains unclear which factors control nanoheterotrophic abundances and biomasses, which showed comparatively little seasonal and between-site fluctuations. Salinity differences were clearly reflected in the protozoan community composition. The dominant role of sessile ciliates is a unique feature of sediments in the freshwater tidal reaches, which can be attributed to the dynamic nature of sedimentation and resuspension processes associated with the maximum turbidity zone. Based on biomass ratios and estimated weight-specific metabolic rates, protozoa possibly accounted for approximately 29 to 96% of the estimated combined metabolic rate of protozoan and metazoan consumers at our sampling stations in late spring/early autumn. The contribution of protozoa to this combined metabolic rate was higher at the sandy than at the silty stations and was mainly accounted for by the nanoheterotrophs. These data emphasize the potential importance of small protozoa in sediments and suggest that protozoa are important components of benthic food webs.},

Due to the small size of the organisms, much effort has been devoted to the development of high-resolution techniques for the observation and understanding of the world of bacteria on a microscale. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy and fluorescent staining, immunofluorescence and other techniques for light microscopy have been the most successful in terms of reaching a high spatial resolution. With respect to our understanding of the microbial microenvironments and of the nature of the microorganisms that carry out the measured metabolic activities, there is still a long way to go. Most chemical and radiotracer techniques in use today operate on a centimeter or at best on a millimeter scale and in most cases their results cannot be directly related to the relevant microorganisms. One notable exception to this is the combined use of autoradiography and fluorescence microscopy on microbial communities.},

   abstract = {Ecological studies often require studying the common structure of a pair of data tables. Co-inertia analysis is a multivariate method for coupling two tables. It is often neglected by ecologists who prefer the widely used methods of redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. We present the co-inertia criterion for measuring the adequacy between two data sets. Co-inertia analysis is based on this criterion as are ca-nonical correspondence analysis or canonical correlation analysis, but the latter two have additional constraints. Co-inertia analysis is very flexible and allows many possibilities for coupling. Co-inertia analysis is suitable for quantitative and/or qualitative or fuzzy environmental variables. Moreover, various weighting of sites and various transformations and/ or centering of species data are available for this method. Hence, more ecological considerations can be taken into account in the statistical procedures. Moreover, the principle of this method is very general and can be easily extended to the case of distance matrices or to the case of more than two tables. Simulated ecological data are used to compare the co-inertia approach with other available methods.},

   abstract = {Methods used for the study of species–environment relationships can be grouped into: (i) simple indirect and direct gradient analysis and multivariate direct gradient analysis (e.g. canonical correspondence analysis), all of which search for non‐symmetric patterns between environmental data sets and species data sets; and (ii) analysis of juxtaposed tables, canonical correlation analysis, and intertable ordination, which examine species–environment relationships by considering each data set equally. Different analytical techniques are appropriate for fulfilling different objectives. We propose a method, co‐inertia analysis, that can synthesize various approaches encountered in the ecological literature. Co‐inertia analysis is based on the mathematically coherent Euclidean model and can be universally reproduced (i.e. independently of software) because of its numerical stability. The method performs simultaneous analysis of two tables. The optimizing criterion in co‐inertia analysis is that the resulting sample scores (environmental scores and faunistic scores) are the most covariant. Such analysis is particularly suitable for the simultaneous detection of faunistic and environmental features in studies of ecosystem structure. The method was demonstrated using faunistic and environmental data from Friday (Freshwater Biology 18, 87‐104, 1987). In this example, non‐symmetric analyses is inappropriate because of the large number of variables (species and environmental variables) compared with the small number of samples. Co‐inertia analysis is an extension of the analysis of cross tables previously attempted by others. It serves as a general method to relate any kinds of data set, using any kinds of standard analysis (e.g. principal components analysis, correspondence analysis, multiple correspondence analysis) or between‐class and within‐class analyses.

   abstract = {The study of inorganic nutrients dynamics in shallow sediments usually focuses on two main pools: porewater (PW) nutrients and exchangeable (EX) ammonium and phosphate. Recently, it has been found that microphytobenthos (MPB) and other microorganisms can accumulate large amounts of nutrients intracellularly (IC), highlighting the biogeochemical importance of this nutrient pool. Storing nutrients could support the growth of autotrophs when nutrients are not available, and could also provide alternative electron acceptors for dissimilatory processes such as nitrate reduction. Here, we studied the magnitude and relative importance of these three nutrient pools (PW, IC, and EX) and their relation to chlorophylls (used as a proxy for MPB abundance) and organic matter (OM) contents in an intertidal mudflat of Cadiz Bay (Spain). MPB was localized in the first 4 mm of the sediment and showed a clear seasonal pattern; highest chlorophylls content was found during autumn and lowest during spring-summer. The temporal and spatial distribution of nutrients pools and MPB were largely correlated. Ammonium was higher in the IC and EX fractions, representing on average 59 and 37% of the total ammonium pool, respectively. Similarly, phosphate in the IC and EX fractions accounted on average for 40 and 31% of the total phosphate pool, respectively. Nitrate in the PW was low, suggesting low nitrification activity and rapid consumption. Nitrate accumulated in the IC pool during periods of moderate MPB abundance, being up to 66% of the total nitrate pool, whereas it decreased when chlorophyll concentration peaked likely due to a high nitrogen demand. EX-Nitrate accounted for the largest fraction of total sediment nitrate, 66% on average. The distribution of EX-Nitrate was significantly correlated with chlorophyll and OM, which probably indicates a relation of this pool to an increased availability of sites for ionic adsorption. This EX-Nitrate pool could represent an alternative nitrate source with significant concentrations available to the microbial community, deeper in the sediment below the oxic layer},

   abstract = {A survey of benthic primary production during periods of emersion was performed in a muddy-sand station of the Bay of Somme. Primary production and respiration were estimated by in situ measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes using infra-red analysis. Photosynthetic response of the community to incident light and temperature was analysed at different periods of the year. Seasonal variations of the photosynthetic parameters were estimated using the photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-I) curves constructed in February, April, July, August and October. The rate of maximum gross community primary production (Pm), highly correlated to sediment chlorophyll a (Chl a) content, was low in February (6.7 mg C m-2h-1) and high in July (97.7 mg C m-2h-1). Photosynthetic efficiency at low light intensity (α) was positively correlated to Pm. The very high production (Pm=126.8 mg C m-2h-1) and productivity (ratio of Pmand sediment Chl a content) measured in March may be related to the set down of active planktonic microalgae. At five dates, the effects of temperature on primary production seemed to overshadow the role of light. The Q10for primary production varied from 1.2 in August to 3.0 in December. Daily potential primary production was calculated as a function of theoretical and measured irradiance for the period of superimposition of day and emersion. At the annual scale, the potential gross community primary production was 147 g C m-2with theoretical irradiance and 110 g C m-2with measured irradiances. The annual community respiration was 188 g C m-2, leading to a heterotrophic annual budget. The annual pattern of daily production can be largely explained by changes in day length. It is also characterized by a fortnightly variability due to the variation of the total daily irradiance available for photosynthesis caused by the superimposition of the tidal and day/night cycles. Finally, sharp variations occurring with nebulosity can overshadow this fortnightly variability. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Cord grass colonization on the Jiangsu coast, eastern China, modifies the native salt marshes in terms of ecosystem structure. The Landsat TM images from 1992 to 2003 were analyzed to identify salt-marsh vegetation distribution patterns and their changes over this coastal region, in order to evaluate the effects of the spreading of the artificially introduced halophyte Spartina. Supervised classification was performed using Bands 3, 4 and 5 in conjunction with in situ training samples, to derive the distribution pattern of the vegetation in the study area. Further, in order to identify the intertidal areas with different tidal elevations, a data treatment procedure was designed to combine regional water level data using harmonic analysis with the waterlines on the TM images extracted by density slice. The results show that: (1) the Spartina alterniflora area has been expanding towards the sea rapidly since it was introduced, especially at initial stages; (2) in the upper part of the inter-tidal zone, the local marsh plant Suaeda salsa and the exotic species Spartina anglica were present only near the sea dyke, occupying only a small part of the entire salt marsh, and the area of these two species has been reduced by land reclamation; (3) there has been a trend for Spartina alterniflora to become the dominant species in the salt marshes in the study area; and (4) the elevation of Spartina alterniflora's seaward fringe was close to mean high water on neaps, and its landward boundary was slightly higher than mean high water. The salt marsh environment of the study area has been modified rapidly by the Spartina vegetation for the last 12 years. © The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

The presence of phaeophytin (Ph) a not only interferes with estimates of Chl a but also with Chl b and c determinations. The universal algorithms can hence be misleading if used on natural collections containing large amounts of Ph. The methanol algorithms are severely affected by the presence of Ph and so are not recommended. The algorithms were tested on representative mixtures of Chls prepared from extracts of algae with known Chl composition. The limits of detection (and inherent error, ±95 % confidence limit) for all the Chl equations were less than 0.03 g m–3. The algorithms are both accurate and precise for Chl a and d but less accurate for Chl b and c. With caution the algorithms can be used to calculate a Chl profile of natural assemblages of algae. The relative error of measurements of Chls increases hyperbolically in diluted extracts. For safety reasons, efficient extraction of Chls and the convenience of being able to use polystyrene cuvettes, the algorithms for ethanol are recommended for routine assays of Chls in natural assemblages of aquatic plants},

While remote sensing has been applied to quantify the spatial distribution of such macroalgae, it is generally not used for their monitoring. We examined the day-to-day and seasonal dynamics of macroalgal cover on a sandy intertidal flat using visible and near-infrared images from a time-lapse camera mounted on a tower. Benthic algae were identified using supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised classification techniques, validated with monthly ground-truthing over one year. A supervised classification (based on maximum likelihood, using training areas identified in the field) performed best in discriminating between sediment, benthic diatom films and macroalgae, with highest spectral separability between macroalgae and diatoms in spring/summer. An automated unsupervised classification (based on the Normalised Differential Vegetation Index NDVI) allowed detection of daily changes in macroalgal coverage without the need for calibration. This method showed a bloom of macroalgae (filamentous green algae, Ulva sp.) in summer with >. 60% cover, but with pronounced superimposed day-to-day variation in cover. Waves were a major factor in regulating macroalgal cover, but regrowth of the thalli after a summer storm was fast (2. weeks). Images and in situ data demonstrated that the protruding tubes of the polychaete Lanice conchilega facilitated both settlement (anchorage) and survival (resistance to waves) of the macroalgae. Thus, high-frequency, high resolution images revealed the mechanisms for regulating the dynamics in cover of the macroalgae and for their spatial structuring. Ramifications for the mode, timing, frequency and evaluation of monitoring macroalgae by field and remote sensing surveys are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Short-term variabil- ity of primary production and photosynthetic characteristics were compared during low tide in 2 types of sediment: sandy and muddy sands. The changes observed were compared with abiotic factors and the biomass abundance, which was dominated by benthic diatoms. 14C uptake values obtained from incubations In a photosynthetron were used for the construction of P-I (photosynthesis-irradiance) curves. Annual averages indicate that both sediments were equally productive (34.5 * 23.6 mg C m-' h-' and 41.1 2 11.6 mg C m-' h-' for the sands and muddy sands respectively), but production rates were highly variable on monthly time scales and were regulated by different mechanisms. Light and temperature played an important role in determining the production rates, especially in the muddy sediments, where changes in I, (light saturation) were correlated with temperature. I, showed seasonal changes, suggesting that algae adapted to the seasonal light conditions but there was not a significant correlation between the Ik and PAR (photosynthetic available radiation) at any of the stations Vertical migration of the algae, as followed by spectroradiometric measurements, probably accounted for a gen- eral absence of photoinhibition. In the sandy sedirnents, production appeared to be limited by the low biomass of algae, due to resuspension and export. The fact that gross oxygen production rates mea- sured on intact cores using microelectrodes were not lower than potential production obtained from 14C fixation suggests that short-term llrnitation of production due to nutrients and/or carbon is not frequent in the microphytobenthos of the Westerschelde.},

Here, we have analyzed two sets of 22 and 35 co-occurring S. ruber strains, newly isolated respectively, from 100 microliters water samples from crystalizer ponds in Santa Pola and Mallorca, located in coastal and inland Mediterranean Spain and 350 km apart from each other. A set of old strains isolated from the same setting were included in the analysis. Genomic and taxonomy relatedness of the strains were analyzed by means of PFGE and MALDI-TOF, respectively, while their metabolomic potential was explored with high resolution ion cyclotron resonance Fourier transform mass spectrometry (ICR-FT/MS). Overall our results show a phylogenetically very homogeneous species expressing a very diverse metabolomic pool. The combination of MALDI-TOF and PFGE provides, for the newly isolated strains, the same scenario presented by the previous studies of intra-specific diversity of S. ruber using a more restricted number of strains: the species seems to be very homogeneous at the ribosomal level while the genomic diversity encountered was rather high since no identical genome patterns could be retrieved from each of the samples. The high analytical mass resolution of ICR-FT/MS enabled the description of thousands of putative metabolites from which to date only few can be annotated in databases. Some metabolomic differences, mainly related to lipid metabolism and antibiotic-related compounds, provided enough specificity to delineate different clusters within the co-occurring strains. In addition, metabolomic differences were found between old and new strains isolated from the same ponds that could be related to extended exposure to laboratory conditions.},

   abstract = {Remote sensing has more advantages than the traditional methods of land surface water (LSW) mapping because it is a low-cost, reliable information source that is capable of making high-frequency and repeatable observations. The normalized difference water indexes (NDWIs), calculated from various band combinations (green, near-infrared (NIR), or shortwave-infrared (SWIR)), have been successfully applied to LSW mapping. In fact, new NDWIs will become available when Advanced Land Imager (ALI) data are used as the ALI sensor provides one green band (Band 4), two NIR bands (Bands 6 and 7), and three SWIR bands (Bands 8, 9, and 10). Thus, selecting the optimal band or combination of bands is critical when ALI data are employed to map LSW using NDWI. The purpose of this paper is to find the best performing NDWI model of the ALI data in LSW map. In this study, eleven NDWI models based on ALI, Thematic Mapper (TM), and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data were compared to assess the performance of ALI data in LSW mapping, at three different study sites in the Yangtze River Basin, China. The contrast method, Otsu method, and confusion matrix were calculated to evaluate the accuracies of the LSW maps. The accuracies of LSW maps derived from eleven NDWI models showed that five NDWI models of the ALI sensor have more than an overall accuracy of 91% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.78 of LSW maps at three test sites. In addition, the NDWI model, calculated from the green (Band 4: 0.525-0.605 μm) and SWIR (Band 9: 1.550-1.750 μm) bands of the ALI sensor, namely NDWIA4,9, was shown to have the highest LSW mapping accuracy, more than the other NDWI models. Therefore, the NDWIA4,9 is the best indicator for LSW mapping of the ALI sensor. It can be used for mapping LSW with high accuracy.. © 2013 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Intertidal areas support extensive diatom-rich biofilms. Such microphytobenthic (MPB) diatoms exude large quantities of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) comprising polysaccharides, glycoproteins and other biopolymers, which represent a substantial carbon pool. However, degradation rates of different EPS components, and how they shape heterotrophic communities in sediments, are not well understood. An aerobic mudflat-sediment slurry experiment was performed in the dark with two different EPS carbon sources from a diatom-dominated biofilm: colloidal EPS (cEPS) and the more complex hot-bicarbonate-extracted EPS. Degradation rate constants determined over 9 days for three sediment fractions [dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total carbohydrates (TCHO), and (cEPS)] were generally higher in the colloidal-EPS slurries (0.105-0.123 d-1) compared with the hot-bicarbonate-extracted-EPS slurries (0.060-0.096 d-1). Addition of hot-bicarbonate-EPS resulted in large increases in dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous by the end of the experiment, indicating that the more complex EPS is an important source of regenerated inorganic nutrients. Microbial biomass increased ~4-6-fold over 9 days, and pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed that the addition of both types of EPS greatly altered the bacterial community composition (from 0 to 9 days) compared to a control with no added EPS. Bacteroidetes (especially Tenacibaculum) and Verrucomicrobia increased significantly in relative abundance in both the hot-bicarbonate-EPS and colloidal-EPS treatments. These differential effects of EPS fractions on carbon-loss rates, nutrient regeneration and microbial community assembly improve our understanding of coastal-sediment carbon cycling and demonstrate the importance of diverse microbiota in processing this abundant pool of organic carbon.},

This paper aims to present vegetation mapping method in the Pays de Brest area by using a time series stacking of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 satellites data using the algorithm Random Forest supervised classification. The types of vegetation mapping in first time are those belonging to the major vegetation types, but especially those that can be observed on the processed images that are the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 series and SPOT-6. The types of classes considered for this study are: no vegetation, forest and undergrowth, moors and lawns, summer crops, winter crops, grassland and water. Several time series stacking has been made on that series containing 140 images radar representing different dates (2017) and the best combination method is to use both the two polarizations VV and VH to the calculation of the matrix of confusion. On the other hand, combinations of SAR images with different vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, S2rep, IRECI) calculated from the Images Sentinel-2 have been made. The series of times series stacking ends with combinations between SPOT-6 and Sentinel-1. The times series stacking Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 are satisfactory, with an overall accuracy that reaches 93%. Such precision is very good for data that are available free.},

   abstract = {The changes in the annual biomass distribution of microphytobenthos (MPB) have been addressed by different studies, although this information is scarce in southern European coastal systems when compared to Northern European estuaries. Moreover, there is little information regarding annual changes in the primary production of MPB related with those in the annual biomass. For this reason, we followed the net production in light, dark respiration rates (determined by oxygen microelectrodes) and MPB abundance (estimated by sediment chlorophyll a) along an intertidal gradient of the inner Cadiz Bay during an annual cycle. Sediment cores were collected seasonally along two transects (5 sampling stations per transect) with contrasting sediment granulometry: muddy (Puerto Real, PR) and muddy-sandy (San Fernando, SF). Our results show that MPB biomass and net production increased seawards reaching maxima in winter. The seasonal maximum of daily solar irradiance and high temperature reached in summer in southern Spain likely inhibits MPB production. Spatial patterns of MPB biomass and net production depend on season and environmental heterogeneity. Environmental variables, analyzed by principal component analyses, were used to explain the variability of MPB metabolism by multiple regression. The principal component axes explained up to 60 % of the microphytobenthic net production and 41 % of the respiration rates in the PR transect while they only explained about 25 % of the same rates in SF. The variability in the environmental variables contributing to the observed patterns implies that no single set of variables can be used to predict net production patterns in the entire system. The different patterns of net production observed between transects highlight the importance of considering the spatial heterogeneity of our system to estimate the contribution of MPB to the inner Cadiz Bay productivity. This production is of major importance since our data showed that microphytobenthic production can contribute up to 49 % of the total benthic production of intertidal sediments of the inner Cadiz Bay.},

   abstract = {Assessments based on monetary valuation of ecosystem services have been increasingly used as a tool to highlight the connection between ecosystems and society. The dissemination of this approach is leading to difficulties and ambiguities related to the use of such assessments in the socio-political realm. Such limits can be stressed using the case study of intertidal bare mudflats. These coastal habitats indeed provide many ecological functions—several being related to the high production of benthic microalgae—but also remain poorly known for some other aspects. The major users of these habitats (i.e. oyster farmers) are still unaware about the trophic role of benthic microalgae, limiting contingent valuation survey methods. Moreover, economic valuation cannot take into account the potentials of mudflats (i.e. undescribed functions) like positive feedbacks related to shellfish farming and provision of bioactive compounds. The lack of physical boundaries in marine systems also strongly reduces the effectiveness of assessments. Lastly, there are concerns that monetary valuation can lead to a commodification of the nature or to the economization of the environment (e.g. appropriation of the environment by users, creation of artificial thresholds). The evaluation of the functions of a socio-ecosystem should not only be restricted to a monetary assessment of its ecosystem services, as this framework may be more reductive than integrative. Some other descriptors—not based on currencies—should be used for ecosystem description.},

A total of 229 algal samples were collected at 17 sites over the period of 2005-2014 on three different substrates in three areas under study: Sivash Gulf, the Kerch Strait and Cape Kazantip. In total, 200 taxa of algae were found, which belong to six taxonomic divisions with a predominance of diatoms. Among those, 108 taxa are indicators of substrate, water temperature, salinity, water pH, trophic state, the type of nutrition and organic pollution of water. It has been shown that the most active self-purification of water takes place in communities on stony substrates. The largest number of algae species (50%) occurs in the cleanest waters of the Kazantip Nature Reserve (Water Quality Classes I-II). The species composition of organic pollution indicators in Sivash Gulf corresponds to waters of Classes III-IV, which are more polluted than those of the Kerch Strait and Cape Kazantip. All the studied areas of the Sea of Azov are cleaner compared to some waters of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Sea of Japan.},

For this study, a framework was designed for automated benthic habitat mapping by combining multiple data sources (hyperspectral, aerial photography, and bathymetry data) and four contemporary imagery processing techniques (data fusion, Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA), machine learning, and ensemble analysis). In the framework, 1-m digital aerial photograph was first merged with 17-m hyperspectral imagery and 10-m bathymetry data using a pixel/feature-level fusion strategy. The fused dataset was then preclassified by three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbor). Final object-based habitat maps were produced through ensemble analysis of outcomes from three classifiers. The framework was tested for classifying a group-level (3-class) and code-level (9-class) habitats in a portion of the Florida Keys. Informative and accurate habitat maps were achieved with an overall accuracy of 88.5% and 83.5% for the group-level and code-level classifications, respectively.},

They differ in definitions and application, but all use key indicators for evaluating eutrophication status. Data from two estuaries in the United Kingdom (UK) were used to test the hypothesis that these five methods would result in the same outcome. The intent is to provide managers with information for selecting an appropriate method, insight about how each method works, how results from different methods compare and a basis for improvement of methods. Results from all approaches indicate that both estuaries required management intervention, but detailed results differed. Methods using more than one biological indicator show that secondary biological impacts were minimal, with the exception of moderate macroalgal problems in the Medway. Comparison of final results was difficult due to differences in: timeframes of data analysis (seasonal versus annual), characteristics included in indicator metrics (concentration, spatial coverage, frequency of occurrence), and methods for combining indicators to determine eutrophication status. This comparison suggests that use of annual data, inclusion frequency of occurrence, spatial coverage and, secondary biological indicators in the index, and a multi-category rating scale results in a more representative assessment. © 2011 US Government.},

In this study, we tested whether the random forest (RF) algorithm could discriminate between papyrus swamp and its co-existent species (Phragmites australis, Echinochloa pyramidalis and Thelypteris interrupta) using in situ canopy reflectance spectra. Canopy spectral measurements were taken from the species using analytical spectral devices but later resampled to Hyperspectral Mapper (HYMAP) resolution. The RF algorithm and a simple forward variable selection (FVS) technique were used to identify key wavelengths for discriminating papyrus swamp and its co-existence species. The method yielded 10 wavelengths located in the visible and short-wave infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum with a lowest out-of-bag (OOB) estimate error rate of 9.5% and.632+ bootstrap error of 8.95%. The use of RF as a classification algorithm resulted in overall accuracy of 90.50% and a kappa value of 0.87, with individual class accuracies ranging from 93.73% to 100%. Additionally, the results from this study indicate that the RF algorithm produces better classification results than conventional classification trees (CTs) when using all HYMAP wavelengths (n = 126) and when using wavelengths selected by the FVS technique. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

Hyperion was tested for its capabilities over a range of water targets in Eastern Australia, including Moreton Bay in southern Queensland. Moreton Bay was the only Australian Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) Hyperion coastal site used for calibration/validation activities. This region was selected due to its spatial gradients in optical depth, water quality, bathymetry, and substrate composition. A combination of turbid and humic river inputs, as well as the open ocean flushing, determines the water quality of the bay. The field campaigns were coincident with Hyperion overpasses, retrieved inherent optical properties, apparent optical properties, substrate reflectance spectra, and water quality parameters. Environmental noise calculations demonstrate that Hyperion has sufficient sensitivity to detect optical water quality concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll, and suspended matter in the complex waters of Moreton Bay. A methodology was developed integrating atmospheric and hydrooptical radiative transfer models (MOD-TRAN-4, Hydrolight) to estimate the underwater light field. A matrix inversion method was applied to retrieve concentrations of chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic matter, and suspended matter, which were comparable to those estimated in the field on the days of the overpass.},

   abstract = {Epilithic microphytobenthos (EMPB) is of core importance in intertidal assemblages and responds to a variety of environmental variables, including season, light, temperature and exposure to waves. To help understand responses by EMPB to these variables and their interactions, EMPB was compared at 2 different latitudes in eastern Australia. In subtropical Brisbane and temperate Sydney, EMPB was sampled at 4 different heights on shores exposed to, or sheltered from, waves during the austral winters and summers of 2006 to 2008. Trends of increasing biomass with decreasing height on shore supported previous studies. In particular, the interaction between season and height was similar to results of previous studies in Australia. There were no differences in biomass of standing stock between Sydney and Brisbane. Differences in timing of sampling occasions confounded some comparisons, and some observed patterns may be due to differences in rates of recolonisation among treatments. Spectrometric assessment of the composition of pigments in EMPB differed with latitude. Spectral samples were more similar to those from assemblages of cyanobacteria than to assemblages of green algae, and this was more marked in Sydney than in Brisbane. Amounts of chlorophyll a were greater on sheltered shores than on those exposed to waves. These patterns are not easily explained, but serve to illustrate the difficulties of extrapolating patterns and processes from one area to another. Variations in pattern at different heights on the shore and in different years emphasise the need for spatially and temporally extensive data in order to make reliable predictions about EMPB. Improved capacity to make reliable predictions will help us understand how EMPB may respond to our changing climate, which is forecast to be hotter with more frequent storms. © Inter-Research 2010.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: Influence of sublittoral microphytobenthos on the flux of oxygen and inorganic nutrients (N, P, Si) at the sediment-water interface was studied using undisturbed cores of sandy and muddy sediment incubated in a laboratory continuous-flow system, either in darkness or with a 16/8 h L/D cycle at in situ light level during summer. Sediment was collected In July at 15 m depth in a non-tidal, stratified bay in SE Kattegat. To test whether the higher content of inorganic nutrients below the halocline, compared with surface waters, could stimulate microphytobenthic growth, 2 levels of nutrient concentrations were used. Diel variations were found In L/D cores, but not in darkened cores, for oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus content in the water overlying the sediment. The flux of NH4+, NO3- and ~0~~- out of the sediment decreased during light periods and occasionally a net uptake was recorded. Light-induced O2 production, and correlations between A fluxes (differences between day and night fluxes of 0, and nutrients), chlorophyll a content and algal cell numbers in the sediment, indicate that the decreased outflux of IN and POA3- was mediated by photosynthetic organisms. Diel variations were not studied for silicon, but a significantly lower outflux, or even an uptake, of Si(OH), from L/D cores supports this conclusion. This suggests that diatoms play a major role in the nutrient flux between sediment and water. Also, the differences in pore-water nutrient gradients between LID and dark cores point to the importance of sediment-associated organisms. Daily (24 h) net fluxes of nutrients were primarily out of the sediment, but the magnitude depended on both light conditions and sediment type. Daily net outflux was significantly lower in UD cores than in darkened cores for all nutrients except NO3- in muddy cores and NO2- in sandy cores. Net uptake in L/D cores was recorded for Si(OH)4 and NO3- In sandy sediment. Outflux of nutrients was significantly higher from muddy sediments in comparison w~th sandy sediments (except NO3-), especially in permanent darkness. No significant effect of nutrient enrichment on the abundance of sublittoral benthic microal- gae could be shown. Results suggest that m~crophytobenthos can influence sediment-water exchange of inorganic nutrients even at sublittoral depths, and when measuring nutrient flux in permanently darkened cores from depths around 15 m in the Kattegat, summer flux rates will be overestimated by a factor varying between 2 and 6, depending on sediment type.

Further, the abundance of microphytobenthos, as indicated by Chlorophyll-a concentration in the sediments, was not directly correlated with concentrations of nutrients in the sediments. Our results suggest that epiphyte and microphytobenthos abundance are not unambiguous indicators of nutrient availability in relatively pristine seagrass environments, and therefore would make poor candidates for indicators of the status and trends of seagrass ecosystems in relatively low-nutrient environments like the Florida Keys. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {This study explores the relationships between environmental factors and the distribution of epilithic diatoms in 161 estuaries of three coastal areas on the Korean peninsula. We investigated epilithic diatoms, water quality, and land use in the vicinities of the estuaries during the months of May 2012, 2013 and 2014, because Korea is relatively free from the influences of rainfall at that time of year. We recorded 327 diatom taxa from the study sites, and the assemblage was dominated by members of the Naviculaceae. Bacillariaceae accounted for the largest proportion of diatoms, and Nitzschia inconspicua (18%) and N. frustulum (9.6%) were the most dominant species. A cluster analysis based on epilithic diatom abundance suggested that the epilithic diatom communities of Korean estuaries can be classified into four large groups (G) according to geography, as follows: Ia-the East Sea watershed, Ib-the eastern watershed of the South Sea, IIa-the West Sea watershed, and IIb-the western watershed of the South Sea. The former two groups, Ia and Ib, showed higher proportions of forest land cover and use, higher species occurrence, lower salinity, lower turbidity, and lower concentrations of nutrients than the latter two groups, while the latter groups, IIa and IIb, had higher proportions of agricultural land cover and use, higher electrical conductivity, higher turbidity, higher concentrations of nutrients, and lower species occurrence. The environmental factors underlying the distribution of epilithic diatoms, representative of each region, are as follows: Dissolved oxygen and forest land cover and use for Reimeria sinuate and Rhoicosphenia abbreviate of the East Sea (ES), salinity and turbidity for Tabularia fasciculate of the West Sea (WS), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nutrients for Cyclotella meneghiniana of the WS. On the other hand, the most influential environmental factors affecting the occurrence of indicator species showing the highest indicator values (>60%) of each group were electrical conductivity for Navicula saprophila and Reimeria sinuate of Ia, and turbidity for Encyonema minutum of IIa. Collectively, the distribution of epilithic diatom communities inhabiting Korean estuaries are determined by geographical factors and water quality, which are in turn influenced by land cover and use, and which differ from east to west.},

The feasibility of using MODIS land/cloud bands to evaluate Secchi Disk Depth (SD) was addressed. The ratio of remote sensing reflectance at 469 and 555 nm was the best predictor for this parameter (R2 = 0.9678; p < 0.05). Landsat-7 ETM+ was, in turn, used to estimate Chlorophyll-a concentration (OC), Turbidity and Salinity. Reflectance values were compared with concurrent in situ data recorded by an automatic sampling buoy. ETM+ data was also used to develop a local water color index, which takes advantage of the relative differences in the reflectance values of the three bands in the visible range of the spectrum. Overall, remote sensing data yielded robust estimates of the selected indicators, favoring its future operational use in the study area. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the recent past, efforts to improve the reliability of LULC maps have seen a proliferation of image classification techniques. Despite these efforts, derived LULC maps are still often judged to be of insufficient quality for operational applications, due to disagreement between generated maps and reference data. In this study we sought to pursue two objectives: first, to test the new-generation multispectral RapidEye imagery classification output using machine-learning random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) classifiers in a heterogeneous coastal landscape; and second, to determine the importance of different RapidEye bands on classification output. Accuracy of the derived thematic maps was assessed by computing confusion matrices of the classifiers' cover maps with respective independent validation data sets. An overall classification accuracy of 93.07% with a kappa value of 0.92, and 91.80 with a kappa value of 0.92 was achieved using RF and SVM, respectively. In this study, RF and SVM classifiers performed comparatively similarly as demonstrated by the results of McNemer's test (Z = 1.15). An evaluation of different RapidEye bands using the two classifiers showed that incorporation of the red-edge band has a significant effect on the overall classification accuracy in vegetation cover types. Consequently, pursuit of high classification accuracy using high-spatial resolution imagery on complex landscapes remains paramount. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Abiotic factors and primary production by phytoplankton and microphytobenthos was studied in the turbid Westeschelde estuary. Because of the high turbidity and high nutrient concentrations primary production by phytoplankton is light-limited. In the inner and central parts of the estuary maximum rates of primary production were therefore measured during the summer, whereas in the more marine part spring and autumn bloom were observed. Organic loading is high, causing near anaerobic conditions upstream in the river Schelde. Because of this there were no important phytoplankton grazers in this part of the estuary and hence the grazing pressure on phytoplankton was minimal. As this reduced losses, biomass is maximal in the river Schelde, despite the very low growth rates. On a number of occasions, primary production by benthic micro-algae on intertidal flats was studied. Comparison of their rates of primary production to phytoplankton production in the same period led to the conclusion that the contribution to total primary production by benthic algae was small. The main reason for this is that the photosynthetic activity declines rapidly after the flats emerged from the water. It is argued that CO2-limitation could only be partially responsible for the noticed decrease in activity. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

   abstract = {Due to the impacts of rural and urban development on southwestern Australian estuaries, and the general isolation of these water bodies, there is a need to develop water quality monitoring systems that are both repetitive and cost-effective. The literature suggests that Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) has spectral and spatial characteristics that are suited to monitoring small coastal water bodies. This study examined the potential for the satellitebased TM sensor to serve as a regular monitoring tool. Atmospherically corrected TM digital data acquired on four dates over summer 1990 / 91 and concurrent field measurements collected at the time of the satellite overpass over the Peel-Harvey Estuarine System (32° 30'S lat. 115° 40'E long.) were used to obtain multitemporal, empirical algorithms for predicting pigment concentration, Secchi disk depth (SDD), and salinity. Highly significant, predictive algorithms were developed for these parameters. It is concluded that Landsat TM has the resolution and accuracy to be a potentially very useful monitoring tool. However, cloud cover and delays in data acquisition seriously diminish its usefulness for monitoring on anything less than a seasonal basis. Laboratory-based radiometric studies also indicated that Landsat TM was unlikely to be useful in determining the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton blooms in coastal waters. © 1993.},

Because MERIS standard SPM concentration retrieval saturates at about 50 g m-3, we developed an alternative method for turbid nearshore waters. The method consists in the combination of the Semi-Analytical Atmospheric and Bio-Optical (SAABIO) atmospheric correction with a regional biooptical algorithm based on a linear relationship between SPM concentration and the reflectance band ratio at 865 and 560 nm. MERIS FR-derived SPM concentrations were validated from 10 up to 300 g m-3, and then merged with oyster ecophysiological responses to provide a spatial picture of the impact of SPM concentration on oyster-farming sites.

   abstract = {© The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Malacological Society of London, all rights reserved.Spatial and temporal variations in gill and palp size were studied during 1 year in naturally-settled populations of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, reciprocally transplanted between two contrasting sites located along a marked gradient of turbidity conditions. The variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and food particles, estimated by the concentration of chlorophyll-a, was measured with in situ water-quality probes. Over a full seasonal cycle, oysters exposed to high-turbidity (HT) conditions exhibited a lower gill-to-palp (G:P) ratio, compared with those exposed to low-turbidity (LT) conditions. Seasonal variations in the G:P ratio were observed at the LT site in relation to the spring phytoplanktonic bloom, but differed from those that had been observed previously. In fact, palp enlargement and gill narrowing (lower seasonal G:P ratio) suggest that oysters improved their pre-ingestive selection efficiency as a priority, rather than their filtering capacity. This result indicates that suspension-feeding bivalves do not have independent plastic responses of their foraging structures to either SPM quality or quantity, and that the direction of variations in the G:P ratio depends on the combination of these two factors. At the HT site, no seasonal pattern was observed in the G:P ratio. This can be explained by the strong hourly variations in SPM and chlorophyll-a, associated with tidal cycles, with daily variations that can be similar to those observed over a year. Reciprocal transplantations showed that oysters originating from the same site can differ in their feeding apparatus morphology when they grow in different environments and that temporal variations in the G:P ratio of oysters transplanted to a new environment converge towards that of individuals that have spent their entire life in this environment. Variations in the relative gill and palp sizes of C. gigas appear therefore to be partly the consequence of reversible phenotypic plasticity in response to spatial and temporal variations in SPM quantity and quality. The results also suggest that the limits and dynamics of gill and palp plasticity are dependent on the origin of oyster populations. Considering its role in the exploitation of different trophic conditions, and consequently in the biological performances (growth and reproduction), plasticity in the feeding apparatus morphology of C. gigas could be a determinant in the establishment of invasive populations in new ecosystems or in the management of farmed oysters.},

SiOZ and NO: concentrations are directly related to freshwater flow whereas PG4-is partially adsorbed by seston in the turbid ebb waters. NH: concentration seems to be, in part, dependent upon sediment resuspension: late ebb and onset of flood periods liberate NH: into the overlying water column, Nutrient concentrations are also related to seasons. Nutrient fluxes are insignificant or negative during summer periods, so the estuary imports nutrients for its own regulation whereas during winter periods it exports Nq and SiO, (ca 50 kg NO, and ca 200 g SiOZ during a single spring tide). The NOs:PO, ratio is always above 15: 1 and can reach 300:l; moreover this ratio fluctuates during the tidal cycle. This imbalance originates in terrestrial discharges of nitrogen compounds.},

Georeferenced hyperspectral and high-resolution fluorescence imaging were coupled to microspatially mapped community composition and relative biomass of macroalgal host and epiphyte microalgal groups, and their weighted contributions to productivity within host fronds of Corallina officinalis on upper and lower zones of a rocky shore were determined. Lower shore epiphytes were dominated by filamentous diatoms (Bacillariophyta), confined to the apex of the frond structure, which were low light acclimated but retained a high capacity for photoprotective down regulation and contributed up to 51% of total community productivity. Upper shore epiphytes were dominated by green algae (Chlorophyta) and single-celled diatoms (principally Cocconeis spp.), which were high light acclimated but present at far lower relative biomass and contributed negligibly to productivity. The host, C. officinalis was the main primary producer. Variation in light environment resulting from differences in shore height and shading within the host macroalga, likely play a large role in determining patterns in epiphyte community structure, biomass and productivity observed. Additionally, microspatial gradients in photophysiological parameters along the host macroalga likely resulted from age-dependent variation in pigments as well as the gradient in light environment.},

Live cells of two microalgal species, Nitzschia closterium and Tetraselmis suesica, were separately entrapped in small alginate microcapsules using an emulsification/internal gelation method. Microcapsule size was adjusted to be within the range of particles ingested by oysters. Using this technique, about 80% of microcapsules had a diameter ranging from 21 to 100 μm. The monitoring of entrapped algae showed that phytoplankton cells remained alive and maintained an active growth for at least 24 days. In particle selection bioassays, adult C. gigas were fed a mixture of microcapsules containing the above algae species as well as control empty alginate microcapsules. The comparison of the proportions of each microcapsule type in the diet and in pseudofeces revealed that those containing T. suesica were significantly ingested while those containing N. closterium were preferentially rejected. Since microcapsule material (alginate matrix) prevented physical contacts between algae cells and oyster feeding organs, this study clearly demonstrate that extracellular metabolites produced by microalgae play a crucial role in the pre-ingestive selection of particles in suspension-feeding bivalves. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Tidal estuaries are regarded as highly important ecosystems, mostly due to their high primary productivity and associated role as carbon sinks. In these ecosystems, primary productivity is mainly due to the photosynthetic carbon fixation by phytoplankton and microphytobenthos. The productivity of the two communities has been mostly studied separately, and directly comparable estimates of their carbon fixation rates in the same estuary are relatively scarce. The present study aimed to characterize the spatio-temporal variability of the productivity of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos in a tidal estuary, the Ria de Aveiro (Portugal). The productivity of the two communities was determined using a common methodological approach, based on measurements of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence, allowing the estimation of the annual ecosystem-level budget for carbon fixation by the two groups. Productivity rates were determined based on synoptic in situ measurements of absolute rates of electron transport rate of photosystem II, using Pulse Amplitude Modulation fluorometry. Chlorophyll fluorescence indices were accompanied by measurements of salinity, temperature, water turbidity, solar irradiance, and planktonic and benthic microalgal biomass. Measurements were carried out hourly, along four spring-neap tidal cycles distributed along 1 year, on three sites of the estuary. The most pronounced trends in the spatio-temporal variability of the photophysiology and productivity of the two communities were the following: (i) maximum biomass and productivity were reached later for microphytobenthos (summer-autumn) than for phytoplankton (spring-summer); (ii) the absorption cross-section of PSII was generally higher for phytoplankton; (iii) the two groups showed a similar photoacclimation state, but microphytobenthos appeared as high light-acclimated when compared to phytoplankton. Biomass-specific productivity was on average higher for phytoplankton than for microphytobenthos, averaging 68.0 and 19.1 mg C mg Chl a–1 d–1, respectively. However, areal depth-integrated production rates were generally higher for the microphytobenthos than for the phytoplankton, averaging 264.5 and 140.0 mg C m–2 d–1, respectively. On an annual basis, phytoplankton productivity averaged 49.9 g C m–2 yr–1 while the productivity of microphytobenthos averaged 105.2 g C m–2 yr–1. When upscaling to the whole estuary, annual primary production rates of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos reached 4894.3 and 7534.0 t C yr–1, respectively, representing 39.4 and 60.6% of the combined total of 12428.3 t C yr–1 determined for the two communities in the Ria de Aveiro.},

   abstract = {The petroleum spilt by the tanker “ Erika” contained environmentally high concentrations of nickel (45 mg kg-1) and vanadium (83 mg kg-1). Our aim was to show that nickel and vanadium concentrations in marine organisms could be used as tracers of their exposure to oil deposits along the coast. Two biomarkers were determined, condition index (CI) and metallothionein levels. Samples were collected monthly from January to May 2000 from five sites along the coast of Vendée and Loire Atlantique: (1) Lérat, (2) La Govelle, (3) Saint Gildas, (4) La Bernerie and (5) La Fosse. Among benthic invertebrates, mussels Mytilus edulis (filter-feeders), periwinkles Littorina littorea (grazing-feeders) and dogwhelks Nucella lapillus (carnivora, bivalve predators) were selected. In addition, mussels were collected from a control site, Fier d’Ars (Ré Island). The species chosen as bioindicators have responded to the presence of oil in their environment by accumulating nickel and vanadium. The bioaccumulation of vanadium occurred early one month after oil spill whereas nickel bioaccumulation was deferred, probably as a consequence of a lower stability of vanadylporphyrins compared to nickelporphyrins which are known in particular for their role in stabilizing emulsions (film at the water/oil interface). Interspecific differences may be explained by different food habits: periwinkles grazed contaminated algae; mussels as filter-feeders retained particles and colloids from the water column; dogwhelks fed on mussels. Spatio-temporal changes of nickel and vanadium concentrations may result from (i) the arrival of new oil slicks, (ii) the action of cleaning of the coasts contributing to the re-suspension of petroleum. In all of the three species, few changes of the CI were observed from site to site. CI variations were linked to sexual ripening in mussels. Mussels originating from the control site showed MT concentrations significantly lower than those in specimens from impacted sites. The highest MT concentrations were observed in January and February, and then a consistent decrease was registered in March and May. MT concentrations in periwinkles increased very significantly in March and May. An increase in MT concentrations was also shown at this period in dogwhelks. Depending on the species, positive correlations were shown between MT and nickel and/or vanadium concentrations. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2004.},

   abstract = {The main criterion for distinguishing morphologically between pollen from wild grasses and that of cultivated grasses is biometric. In Western Europe, the biometric threshold generally used is 45 μm for grain diameter and 8 μm for annulus diameter, a threshold above which the pollen is attributed to cereals. However, for the seaboard, these criteria are not satisfactory because indigenous grass species have large sized pollen grains (> 45 μm and > 8 μm). When we realize palynological studies to answer questions about anthropisation or early beginnings of agricultural activities, it is important to clearly differentiate pollen grains of littoral wild grasses from cultivated grasses. In the present study, we propose a new biostatistical approach to advance the discrimination of the two types mentioned above. In this matter, we used 35 species of wild grasses from the Armorican littoral (France) and 4 species of Cerealia type grasses. For each sample, diameter and annulus sizes of 300 grains were measured to calculate the mean values. Technics of observations and measurements were identical to the ones utilized to analyse fossil samples. Statistical analysis allowed us to show a biometric threshold coinciding to a combination of two values of diameter: 47 μm for grain diameter and 11 μm for annulus diameter. The pertinence of this pair of threshold values was tested a posteriori using assessment criteria such as specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values. The threshold 47-11 μm appeared to be a discriminant pair, placing a minimum of wild grasses into the Cerealia type group while retaining the maximum of cereals in this same group. Furthermore, this biostatistical approach could be applied more generally on different corpus of grasses. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The proliferation of the voluntarily-introduced cupped oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has attained the proportions of species invasion in many intertidal habitats in Europe, presumably resulting from successful reproduction of farmed individuals. It is thus imperative to better understand the reproductive characteristics of farmed oysters, since they are directly under human control. We quantified the dry tissue mass (DTM), gametosomatic index (GSI), and reproductive cycle of farmed oysters at two sites in Bourgneuf Bay, France, in relation to environmental parameters using continuously-recording probes in 2005 and 2006. The GSI was developed for this study, based on the actual area occupied by gametes, rather than the area of the gonad previously used for quantitative histological estimation of reproductive effort. The two sites, intermediate - (IT) and high-turbidity (HT), differed markedly in the amount and quality of particulate suspended matter, and also in fine-scale temperature variations. Oysters at both sites presented two spawning periods in both 2005 and 2006; Bourgneuf Bay is thus near the northernmost European limit for a 2-spawning cycle in Crassostrea gigas. Gonad maturation was initiated when spring water temperature reached 8-10 °C, and gamete atresia occurred when water temperatures transiently dipped to 15-18 °C. Spawns, which occurred above 18 °C, were timed by fine-scale water temperature variations. Particulate organic matter quality peaks, coinciding with gonad maturation, were related to DTM variations before spawning periods, for the IT oysters in both years, and for the HT oysters in 2006. The reproductive effort (GSI) of oysters was similar at both sites; however, the fates of the gametes differed according to site. At the first spawning, the IT oyster gamete emissions were +1 month delayed, as were peak water temperatures greater than 18 °C, and more pronounced, compared to the HT site. Although the second spawning showed high proportions of atretic oocytes at both sites in both years, the IT oysters evacuated twice as many gametes as the HT oysters in 2005. The IT conditions therefore appear more suited to Crassostrea gigas gamete evacuation than the HT conditions. © 2009 EDP Sciences.},

Leaves were sampled each month from March to November and spectral reflectance was measured in the 400-900nm wavelength range in the laboratory for increasing biomass. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to assess the pigment composition and concentration of the leaves and their epiphytes. Several vegetation indices (VIs) were tested for their sensitivity to seasonal variations, from NDVI-like ratios to indices based on derivative analysis. Pigment concentration showed a seasonal effect, with the highest concentrations observed in summer, synchronous with the above-ground biomass peak. The seasonal variations were clearly visible in the leaf reflectance spectrum, showing for the same amount of vegetation, lower reflectance in summer for the visible wavelengths and a higher near-infrared (NIR) plateau compared to the other months. Indices based on the difference between the red and NIR reflectance values, typically all the NDVI-like ratios, were the most sensitive to seasonal variations in pigment concentration. In fact, seasonal effects were systematically reduced for VIs including a blue band correction, namely the modified Specific Ratio (mSR(705)), the modified Normalized Difference (mND(705)), the modified NDVIs for Landsat, FORMOSAT and narrow band NDVI (mNDVI(673)) as well as the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI). However, these indices showed a faster saturation for increasing seagrass biomass, except for the mSR(705), which was the least sensitive to biomass saturation. The interesting properties of this index suggest that it should now be tested for airborne or satellite remote sensing mapping of Z. noltii beds but it requires a high spectral resolution and cannot be applied to multispectral satellite images. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Mathematical models based upon the detoxification patterns of digestive gland and other tissues were developed. It was demonstrated that biotransformations do not seem to play an important role in digestive gland or other tissue detoxification kinetics with our data set. Moreover, different toxin transfers from digestive gland toward other tissues were investigated. No significant transfer was highlighted in our data set. These first conclusions were drawn after comparing the results obtained from 13 biotransformations and identifiable transfer scenarios. Finally, to determine a more robust model, all 12 states corresponding to toxic compounds and tissues were aggregated into a single state model. The best adjustment was obtained with a simple one-compartment model based on total flesh toxicity with elimination rate expressed by a function depending on initial concentrations of GTX3 and GTX2 (i.e. the two major toxic compounds found in contaminated oysters). © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, the capability of the Sentinel 2 constellation to cover coastal areas and measure coastal processes –physical and biological. We show that Sentinel 2 enables high-frequency measurements across the globe. Cloud coverage at higher latitudes is overcome by decrease revisit time-intervals. Only around the equator, the longest revisit intervals and high cloud cover probability limits coastal measurements there. Sentinel 2 based methods are capable of estimating Digital Elevation Models for mid- to high-latitude coastal zones and sporadic spots for lower latitudes where 2 orbit swaths overlap. For the majority of the world's coastal bathymetries can be obtained with the Sentinel 2 imagery surpassing the depth of closure (beyond this offshore limit sediment transport is limited). Only in sheltered areas, wave-based bathymetry inversion is limited but at these areas inversion through colouring (light penetration) prevails. This works shows that Sentinel 2 enables coastal monitoring as never before, large spatial scale with revisits of a few days at most of the world.},

In particular, no information has been previously available concerning the capacity for qualitative particle selection - typical of C. gigas - in C. fornicata. Firstly, we investigated the anatomical-functional potential for selection in the feeding structures of C. fornicata using scanning electron microscopy, video-endoscopy, histology and mucocyte characterization. Secondly, the relative performance of qualitative selection by these 2 species was compared under experimental particle concentrations similar to those in the natural habitat, using the naturally occurring diatom Coscinodiscus perforatus var. pavillardii and the live cell/empty, cleaned frustule approach. In contrast to C. gigas, the feeding structures of C fornicata showed no anatomical or functional potential for qualitative selection. Furthermore, although C. gigas demonstrated significant qualitative selection in selection experiments, C. fornicata demonstrated none. This fundamental difference in suspension-feeding mode will predetermine the approaches that can be used in future studies on trophic interactions, and suggests that the degree of diet overlap will depend on the extent and time periods within which oysters engage in qualitative selection. © Inter-Research 2007.},

   abstract = {The revival capacity of eight species of diatoms rejected in pseudofaeces and faeces of a filter-feeder, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas Thunberg, was assessed by experimental culture tests. Isolated from oyster fattening ponds near Bourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast (46-47°N, 1-2°W), the eight diatom species were: Amphora sp., Chaetoceros sp., Entomoneis alata, Haslea ostrearia, Nitzschia acicularis, Nitzschia closterium, Nitzschia gandersheimiensis and Skeletonema costatum. The results show that none of the diatoms were totally digested and that all underwent significant growth. Cell concentrations with pseudofaecal cultures were higher for all species excepted Haslea ostrearia for which the difference with faecal cultures was not significant. This result is consistent with the fact that diatoms rejected in faeces are processed through the bivalve gut, while pseudofaeces are simply formed on the gill and the palps. Nevertheless, the significant biomass obtained with faecal cultures compared to a control, confirms that diatoms have signficant survival after extracellular digestion by the oyster. Survival was probably facilitated by the large amount of inorganic particles added to experimental diets to reproduce conditions characteristic of intertidal oysters cultivated on mudflats. This variable has probably more significance for the revival process than the size of the microalgae or its ecological type in such environment.},

For periphyton, similar data are scarce. We investigated the changes in cellular C:N:P stoichiometry of benthic microalgae in response to different levels and types of nutrient limitation and a variety of abiotic conditions in laboratory experiments with natural inocula. C:N ratios increased with decreasing growth rate, irrespective of the limiting nutrient. At the highest growth rates, the C:N ratio ranged uniformly around 7.5. N:P ratios < 13 indicated N limitation, while N:P ratios > 22 indicated P limitation. Under P limitation, the C:P ratios increased at low growth rate and varied around 130 at highest growth rates. For a medium with balanced supply of N and P, an optimal stoichiometric ratio of C:N:P = 119:17:1 could be deduced for benthic microalgae, which is slightly higher than the Redfield ratio (106: 16: 1) considered typical for optimally growing phytoplankton. The optimal ratio was stable against changes in abiotic conditions. In conclusion, cellular nutrient ratios are proposed as an indicator for nutrient status in periphyton.},

Dissolved excretion and mineralization of biodeposits (pseudofaeces and faeces), two indirect processes related to their feeding activity, have already been identified. This study investigated whether microalgal growth is also dependent on the mucus secreted by bivalves and rejected with their biodeposits. An experimental study based on algal growth tests was conducted to determine whether the mucus coating the pseudofaeces and faeces of the oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) could stimulate the growth of nine marine microalgae: a Prasinophyceae [Tetraselmis suecica (Butcher)] and eight Diatomophyceae [Amphora sp.

Oysters were fed only inorganic particles at a concentration well above the threshold of pseudofaeces production. A fraction of pseudofaeces and faeces was then inoculated into glass tubes containing a single algal species. Algal growth tests showed that mucus stimulated the growth of four of the nine species studied: Chaetoceros sp., H. ostrearia, N. gandersheimiensis and T. suecica. The strongest responses were observed with H. ostrearia and Chaetoceros sp., for which mean algal biomass was significantly higher with mucus originating from pseudofaeces than faeces. Monitoring of the release of dissolved components from mucus showed significant enrichment in inorganic phosporus. The use of an antibiotic treatment suggested that this dissolved component is released by simple solubilization rather than by bacterial breakdown.},

Labial palp area was closely and positively related to the turbidity gradient. No clear pattern was established between the gill area and the gradient of suspended particulate matter (SPM). The functional responses induced by these morphological variations were investigated in the laboratory by means of ecophysiological experiments and endoscopic observations. Oysters with different pallial organ areas were supplied with mixed suspensions of heat-killed Tetraselmis suecica and living Skeletonema costatum added to different concentrations of kaolinite to simulate low (SPM = 8.5 ± 0.4 mg l- 1) and high (SPM = 48.3 ± 1.4 mg l- 1) turbidity conditions. At each SPM concentration, heat-killed T. suecica were preferentially rejected in pseudofaeces compared to S. costatum, indicating a preingestive particle selection. At low seston load, clearance rate (CR) was closely and positively related to gill area and particle selection occurred only on the gills, between the ventral grooves and dorsal tracts. At higher seston load, palps exhibited a particle-sorting capacity dependent on gill area. Indeed, with small gills, an increase in selection efficiency (SE) and CR was positively related to palp area. On the other hand, large gills processed the particles without an effect of palps but with a decrease in CR. The functional responses associated with pallial organ variations clearly showed that the preingestive particle processing in oysters is an integrated mechanism dependant on the gill and labial palp areas. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aim: The spread of non-indigenous species in marine ecosystems world-wide is one of today's most serious environmental concerns. Using mechanistic modelling, we investigated how global change relates to the invasion of European coasts by a non-native marine invertebrate, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Location: Bourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast was considered as the northern boundary of C. gigas expansion at the time of its introduction to Europe in the 1970s. From this latitudinal reference, variations in the spatial distribution of the C. gigas reproductive niche were analysed along the north-western European coast from Gibraltar to Norway. Methods: The effects of environmental variations on C. gigas physiology and phenology were studied using a bioenergetics model based on Dynamic Energy Budget theory. The model was forced with environmental time series including in situ phytoplankton data, and satellite data of sea surface temperature and suspended particulate matter concentration. Results: Simulation outputs were successfully validated against in situ oyster growth data. In Bourgneuf Bay, the rise in seawater temperature and phytoplankton concentration has increased C. gigas reproductive effort and led to precocious spawning periods since the 1960s. At the European scale, seawater temperature increase caused a drastic northward shift (1400 km within 30 years) in the C. gigas reproductive niche and optimal thermal conditions for early life stage development. Main conclusions: We demonstrated that the poleward expansion of the invasive species C. gigas is related to global warming and increase in phytoplankton abundance. The combination of mechanistic bioenergetics modelling with in situ and satellite environmental data is a valuable framework for ecosystem studies. It offers a generic approach to analyse historical geographical shifts and to predict the biogeographical changes expected to occur in a climate-changing world.},

The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the IR/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the IR/red ratio. Less than a 6% difference separated the highest and lowest of these four ER and red linear combinations.

ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10. m to 60. m depending on the spectral band with a 290. km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five days at the equator.

   abstract = {We present an approach to field-based remote sensing of the spatial variation of chlorophyll (as an index of microphytobenthic biomass) in intertidal soft sediments using digital colour-infrared imagery. Variation in amounts of chlorophyll a was quantified from small (cm) to large (100 m) scales within a single tidal cycle, using levels of replication and resolution that would be difficult to achieve using conventional sampling strategies. Eight scales of interest were selected: 100, 50, 2 and 1 m, and 40, 8, 4 and <(4 and <2 cm) 2 cm. These scales have been associated with variability in chlorophyll in previous studies. The fully hierarchical design allowed spatial variance to be estimated independently at each chosen spatial scale. Data were collected along 2 replicate transects at 2 locations within each of 2 different estuaries. A strong linear relationship was found between measured chlorophyll and image estimates of chlorophyll. Replicate transects in 2 of the 4 locations showed similar patterns of variability across spatial scales. Relatively large amounts of variability were found at the smallest spatial scales (4 and <2 cm) and at the 40 cm scale, but the 8 cm scale was an unimportant source of variation. At some scales, transects gave similar results, providing generality to the conclusions reached. At other scales, transects gave quite different results, drawing attention to problems of inferring ecological processes when there are only single sets of data. Large differences in variability were also found from location to location. These patterns suggest that spatial variability is governed by complex interactions between fauna, microflora and sediment. © Inter-Research 2008.},

The use of remote sensing techniques allows monitoring of photosynthesis at the ecosystem level and improves our knowledge of plant primary productivity. The main objective of the current study was to develop a remote sensing based method to measure microphytobenthos (MPB) prima ry production from intertidal mudflats. This was achieved by coupling hyperspectral radiometry (reflectance, ρ and second derivative, δδ) and PAM-fluorometry (non-sequential light curves, NSLC) measurements. The latter allowed the estimation of primary production using a light use efficiency parameter (LUE) and electron transport rates (ETR) whereas ρ allowed to estimate pigment composition and optical absorption cross-section (a*). Five MPB species representative of the main growth forms: epipelic (benthic motile), epipsammic (benthic motile and non motile) and tychoplanktonic (temporarily resus-pended in the water column) were submitted to increasing light intensities from dark to 1950 μmol photons.m -2 .s -1 . Different fluorescence patterns were observed for the three growth-forms and were linked to their xanthophyll cycle (de-epoxydation state). After spectral reflectance measurements, a* was retrieved using a radiative transfer model and several radiometric indices were tested for their capacity to predict LUE and ETR measured by PAM-fluorometry. Only one radiometric index was not species or growth-form specific, i.e. δδ 496/508 . This index was named MPB LUE and could be used to predict LUE and ETR. The applicability of this index was tested with simulated bands of a wide variety of hyperspectral sensors at spectral resolutions between 3 and 15 nm of Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM).},

   abstract = {Trophodynamics of intertidal mudflats are significantly driven by microphytobenthos (MPB) production but spatial and temporal dynamics of this production source is poorly known. To understand the temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of intertidal MPB, benthic chlorophyll a, phaeopigments, and sediment properties were determined in Gyehwa (sandy) and Gwanghwal (muddy) tidal flats of Saemangeum area over a year at 97 stations. This study set out to: (i) characterize the spatial-temporal patterns in MPB biomass on a year-round basis, (ii) identify the abiotic and biotic factors associated with MPB distributions, (iii) investigate the use of satellite-derived chlorophyll a data and verify with in field measurements, and (iv) determine minimum required sample size for in situ biomass measurement. Concentrations of benthic chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were greater in winter and spring with a high magnitude of variance than in summer and fall at both areas. Benthic chlorophyll a and phaeopigments tended to decrease approaching lower tidal zone, being associated with the corresponding decrease in shore level and/or exposure duration. Compared to available data on macrozoobenthos distribution, the spatial variation of microalgal biomass seems to be attributed to distribution of deposit-feeders. A significant positive correlation (p < 0.001) between in situ MPB biomass and satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values was observed, but was much weaker in the lower tidal zone. Mirroring algal heterogeneity, the minimum required sample size for in situ biomass measurement were greater in blooming season and sandy bottom, suggesting that sampling design for spatio-temporal mapping of MPB should consider the sampling season and/or abiotic and biotic features of study area. Overall, spatio-temporal dynamics of intertidal MPB seem to be influenced by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors.},

   abstract = {The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, well known throughout the world because of its ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions, was introduced for cultivation into France on a massive scale in the 1970s. With global warming, the reproductive population, confined at the beginning to the south of the French Atlantic coast, became established at more northern latitudes (above 45° 58′ N), and wild C. gigas began to colonize coastal areas such as our study site, Bourgneuf Bay (1°-2° W, 46°-47° N), an oyster-farming site. An original approach, based on orthophotograph analysis and in situ biomass sampling, revealed that, in the northern part of this bay, more than 70% of the total C. gigas biomass was composed of wild oysters (i.e. C. gigas not bred by oystermen). The analysis of the spatial distribution of wild oysters indicated that 75% of the stock consisted of wild oysters in natural beds (rocky areas) and on low retaining walls of former fisheries. Wild C. gigas also colonized oyster-farming structures with lower biomasses (21% of the stock composed of wild oysters), but locally they could reach densities of up to 55 kg.m- 1 i.e. 2.5 times the mean biomass of cultivated oysters. The economic and ecological consequences of this colonization by C. gigas of an oyster culture site are discussed. Wild oyster seems to be the principal trophic competitor of cultivated oysters in Bourgneuf Bay. This may partly explain the decrease in growth of cultivated oysters observed in this bay during the last decade. Moreover, the trophic and spatial competition exerted by wild oysters may also affect the native biota and, in particular, the honeycomb worm Sabellaria alveolata. The results obtained in this study have led oyster farmers and regional authorities to modify oyster-farming practices and to destroy wild oyster stocks in concession areas. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Spatial size variations of labial palps, gills and the adductor muscle of the invasive feral oyster, Crassostrea gigas, were studied along two gradients of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in the temperate macrotidal Bourgneuf Bay, (annual mean SPM concentration gradient of 21.0-154.0 mg l-1) and the adjacent Loire Estuary (annual mean SPM concentration gradient of 24.1-630.4 mg l-1) on the French Atlantic Coast. The gill-to-palp (G:P) ratios decreased with increasing turbidity, both in the bay and the estuary. Changes in G:P ratios were chiefly related to palp area variations, increasing gradually from low turbidity to very high-turbidity sites, while gill area showed no clear relationship with turbidity conditions. The G:P ratio, showing a significant relationship (r2 = 0.97) with SPM concentrations, is proposed as a pallial organ index of oyster acclimation to turbidity conditions. The area of the striated part of the adductor muscle was always greater than that of the smooth one, and adductor muscle area tended to decrease when SPM concentration increased. These observations show the morphological capacity of the oyster C. gigas to tolerate SPM concentrations above the feeding cessation thresholds previously determined experimentally. They also suggest that pallial organ size variations could help explain the success of recent feral oyster invasions in temperate turbid ecosystems. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {An ecophysiological deterministic model of growth, reproduction and interactions between the bivalve and its estuarine environment was established for the Japanese oyster Crassostrea gigas. The environmental variables used in the model are: total particulate matter, particulate organic matter, particulate inorganic matter, chlorophyll, phaeopigments, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. Rates of clearance, filtration, ingestion, absorption and respiration along with efficiencies of retention, selection and absorption are modelled with endogenous (dry weight of the animal, energy allocation between growth and reproduction) and exogenous variables (temperature, food quality and quantity). The model simulate the temporal evolution of two compartments: somatic and storage-gonad. Absorbed energy is allocated to soma up to a maximum somatic growth. This maximum decreases with age and never exceeds 0.02 g.d-1.oyster-1. Energy in excess is allocated to the storage-gonad compartment. The model identify storage and gametogenesis periods and correctly predicts spawning intensity. In this model, the oyster selectively reject inorganic from organic particles, enriching the ingested ration. Within potentially nutritive particles, fewer particles containing phytopigments are rejected compared with detritic particles. Absorption efficiency is represented as a function of organic content in the ingested ration. Microphytes are absorbed with an efficiency which fluctuates from 20 to 60%. The model predicts negative absorption for detritic material to take into account metabolic faecal losses. Theses formulations provide information about the temporal evolution of the amount of microphytes and detritic matter biodeposited as pseudofaeces and faeces.},

They are however threatened, mostly due to the increase of human activities. Seagrasses have the capacity to adapt their morphological, physiological, and mechanical traits to their local conditions. Mechanical traits have been identified as a good tool to investigate a plant-species capacity to withstand physical forces or disturbances but are still sparsely studied in seagrasses. With this study, we aimed to assess how the mechanical traits of a broadly spread seagrass species vary along a latitudinal gradient in relation to its morphometric plasticity and nutrient status. We found that seagrasses acclimate their mechanical traits in relation to their physiological or morphological traits, both over the growing season and across a latitudinal range: leaves were weaker and thinner in northern areas, particularly at the end of the growing season. Besides the influence of the latitudinal gradient, leaf mechanical strength and stiffness were both strongly affected by their morphometric plasticity. Moreover, we showed that leaves mechanical traits change depending on their nutrient status: leaves were stronger and stiffer in oligotrophic conditions as compared to more eutrophic conditions. Thus, our results imply that, under eutrophication, leaves become weaker and thus more vulnerable to physical forces. This vulnerability is higher in the north at the end of the growing season. The latter is consistent with the more ephemeral character of northern seagrass meadows, in contrast to the more evergreen southern meadows.},

Estuarine habitats in the coastal zone are under pressure from a range of human activities. In the United States and elsewhere, very few conservation plans focused on estuaries are regional in scope; fewer still address threats to estuary long term viability.We have compiled basic information about the spatial extent of threats to identify commonalities. To do this we classify estuaries into hierarchical networks that share similar threat characteristics using a spatial database (geodatabase) of threats to estuaries from land and sea in the western U.S.Our results show that very few estuaries in this region (16%) have no or minimal stresses from anthropogenic activity. Additionally, one quarter (25%) of all estuaries in this study have moderate levels of all threats. The small number of un-threatened estuaries is likely not representative of the ecological variability in the region and will require working to abate threats at others. We think the identification of these estuary groups can foster sharing best practices and coordination of conservation activities amongst estuaries in any geography. © 2011 Merrifield et al.},

As no data are available concerning the ecophysiological response of this species, the purpose of the present study was to obtain clearance rate and retention efficiency values to provide a first order of magnitude for the trophic role of this species. Data were obtained using a flow-through system with novel troughs suitable for 225 cm2 reef blocks containing a mean number of 940 ± 102 (S.E.) individuals. The experimental diet used consisted of a mixture of two live microalgae, Skeletonema costatum (3800 cell ml-1) and Isochrysis galbana (23 700 cell ml-1), chosen to cover a broad size range (2 to 16 μm equivalent spherical diameter, ESD), as determined by a particle counter. On the basis of a mean clearance rate of 0.71h-1 obtained with reef blocks, the mean rate for an individual was estimated at 7.5 × 10-4 Lh-1. Particles larger than 6 μm ESD were cleared with 100% efficiency, but S. alveolata was unable to retain particles smaller than 2 μm ESD. The results are compared with data obtained for other polychaete species, and clearance rate values are extrapolated to an entire reef. © 2003 Académie des sciences.

   abstract = {Feeding, selection and absorption were determined for the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas cultivated in the Bay of Marennes-Oleron, over a spring/neap tidal cycle. Physiological determinations were related to the highly variable food environment with continuous recordings of turbidity and fluorescence. In this bay, resuspension processes have a major influence on food availability and quality. Seston characteristics experienced by oysters can be summarized by high turbidity levels from 20 to 350 mg · l-1 and a predominance of the detritic fraction among the organic fraction (mean C/N ratio = 16.57). Food is diluted by the fine resuspended sediment, and organic content of particulate matter in the water column decreases from 30% to 10% with increasing seston loads. Significant differences (Ancova, P < 0.01), due to low retention efficiencies of the smaller particle size range, were recorded between the food quality (estimated by the organic content and the total pigment content) measured in the water column and the fraction retained by the oyster's gill. Below seston concentrations of 90 mg · l-1 ingestion rate was regulated by pseudofaecal production. Above 90 mg · l-1 , a sharp reduction of filtration and rejection rates suggests physical constraints limiting food acquisition. The oyster selectively rejects inorganic from organic particlesm, enriching the ingested fraction. Amongst the potentially nutritive particles, significantly fewer particles containing phytopigments were rejected relative to organic particles (non-linear regressions, P < 0.001). The negative influence, through food dilution, of high seston loads on net absorption efficiency was determined. This efficiency decreases with decreasing organic ingested fraction. Scope for growth calculations confirm the negative influence of seston loads, but show, supported by field growth measurements, that resuspended organic particles play an important role in the oyster's nutrition.},

   abstract = {Sabellaria alveolata, a ciliary suspension feeder, is a reef-building polychaete widely distributed in European waters, and is an important element of the trophic web of the ecosystems they have colonised. The lack of data concerning the feeding mechanisms of polychaete sabellariids is an impediment to understanding their roles in these systems. In this study, we combine a descriptive approach based on SEM observations and histological mapping of mucocytes with video endoscopic recordings to provide a functional interpretation of particle capture and processing mechanisms. It is hypothesised that particle capture in S. alveolata is based on the beat of grouped cilia. The cilia types and distributions of tentacles are described, and both downstream and upstream collecting mechanisms are demonstrated in this species. Other feeding characteristics, such as the flicking of tentacles, are involved in particle capture. Feeding mechanisms suggest previously unsuspected similarities with lophophorids. The role of mucus in S. alveolata was characterised in the tentacles, grooves and buccal cavity, and the functional specialisation of organs in transport or rejection of particles was confirmed with video recordings. Tentacles and grooves collect and transport particles towards the mouth, and only viscous acid mucopolysaccharide-secreting mucocytes occurred on these organs, protecting particles from being removed with currents. The presence of mixed mucocytes on the cephalic floor, situated just posterior to the mouth, suggests that this area is involved in rejection of pseudofaeces. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of environmental adaptation and are compared to other families of ciliary suspension-feeding polychaetes. © Inter-Research 2005.},

Field measurements suggest that Sargassum has a distinctive reflectance curvature of ~ 630. nm due to its chlorophyll c pigments, which provides a unique spectral signature when combined with the reflectance ratio between brown (~ 650. nm) and green (~ 555. nm) wavelengths. For a 10-nm resolution sensor on the hyperspectral HyspIRI mission currently being planned by NASA, a stepwise rule to examine several indexes established from 6 bands (centered at 555, 605, 625, 645, 685, 755. nm) is shown to be effective to unambiguously differentiate Sargassum from all other floating materials Numerical simulations using spectral endmembers and noise in the satellite-derived reflectance suggest that spectral discrimination is degraded when a pixel is mixed between Sargassum and water. A minimum of 20-30% Sargassum coverage within a pixel is required to retain such ability, while the partial coverage can be as low as 1-2% when detecting floating materials without spectral discrimination. With its expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs ~ 200:1), the hyperspectral HyspIRI mission may provide a compromise between spatial resolution and spatial coverage to improve our capacity to detect, discriminate, and quantify Sargassum.},

A stock of marketable Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas was therefore stored during 22 days in non-immersed conditions at 3 °C with 100% humidity. At the end of the experiment, the oyster mortality rate remained at a low level of less than 3.5%. The sensory attributes, odour, appearance, texture and flavour, did not show significant variations. However, the oyster total weight and fresh flesh weight exhibited losses of 10.5% and a 16.6% after 15 days of storage. At the same time, intervalval water showed a decrease in quality with 20% of the samples characterized by an absence of intervalval water with a flesh more or less moist.

In France, oyster cultivation has conventionally taken place in the intertidal zone, where there is little or no further room for expansion. Despite interest in moving production further offshore, more information is needed regarding the biological potential for offshore oyster growth, including its spatial and temporal variability. This study shows the use of remotely-sensed chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter concentrations retrieved from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), and sea surface temperature from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), all validated using in situ matchup measurements, as input to run a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) Pacific oyster growth model for a study site along the French Atlantic coast (Bourgneuf Bay, France). Resulting oyster growth maps were calibrated and validated using in situ measurements of total oyster weight made throughout two growing seasons, from the intertidal zone, where cultivation currently takes place, and from experimental offshore sites, for both spat (R2 = 0.91; RMSE = 1.60 g) and adults (R2 = 0.95; RMSE = 4.34 g). Oyster growth time series are further digested into industry-relevant indicators, such as time to achieve market weight and quality index, elaborated in consultation with local producers and industry professionals, and which are also mapped. Offshore growth is found to be feasible and to be as much as two times faster than in the intertidal zone (p < 0.001). However, the potential for growth is also revealed to be highly variable across the investigated area. Mapping reveals a clear spatial gradient in production potential in the offshore environment, with the northeastern segment of the bay far better suited than the southwestern. Results also highlight the added value of spatiotemporal data, such as satellite image time series, to drive modeling in support of marine spatial planning. The current work demonstrates the feasibility and benefit of such a coupled remote sensing-modeling approach within a shellfish farming context, responding to real and current interests of oyster producers.},

   abstract = {In many coastal plain estuaries light attenuation by suspended sediments confines the photic zone to a small fraction of the water column, such that light limitation is a major control on phytoplankon production and turnover rate. For a variety of estuarine systems (e.g. San Francisco Bay, Puget Sound, Delaware Bay, Hudson River plume), photic-zone productivity can be estimated as a function of phytoplankton biomass times mean irradiance of the photic zone. Net water column productivity also varies with light availability, and in San Francisco Bay net productivity is zero (estimated respiratory loss of phytoplankton balances photosynthesis) when the ratio of photic depth (Zp) to mixed depth (Z,,,) is less than about 0.2. Thus whenever Zp:Z,,, < 0.2, the water column is a sink for phytoplankton production. Much of the spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton biomass or productivity in estuaries is explained by variations in the ratio of photic depth to mixed depth. For example, phytoplankton blooms often coincide with stratification events that reduce the depth of the surface mixed layer (increase Zp:Zm). Shallow estuarine embayments (high Zp:Z,,) are often characterized by high phytoplankton biomass relative to adjacent channels (low Zp:Zm). Many estuaries have longitudinal gradients in productivity that mirror the distribution of suspended sediments: productivity is low near the riverine source of sediments (low Zp:Z,,) and increases toward the estuary mouth where turbidity decreases. Some of these generalizations are qualitative in nature, and detailed understanding of the interaction between turbidity and estuarine phytoplankton dynamics requires improved understanding of vertical mixing rates and phyto-plankton respiration.},

In macrotidal shellfish ecosystems, this species competes for food with cultivated suspension-feeders. The suspension-feeding activity and clearance rate of S. alveolata were investigated in response to changes in seston concentration. A flow-through system was designed to study 225 cm2 reef blocks with more than 500 individuals. The experimental conditions were characterized by increasing concentrations of suspended particulate matter ranging from 6.5 to 153.8 mg L-1, while the organic content of the diet (microalgae Skeletonema costatum) decreased inversely from 49 to 9%, to mimic the dilution of organic matter by inorganic particles, characteristic of tidal resuspension. We showed that the clearance rate exponentially decreased in relation to an increase in SPM concentration. Clearance rate was estimated at 5.3 10- 3 L h- 1 or 0.93 L h- 1 g- 1 (dry weight) for the lowest seston concentration (SPM = 6.5 mg L- 1) and reached the asymptote at CR = 1.97 10- 3 L h- 1 or 0.35 L h- 1 g- 1 (dry weight) when SPM exceeded 45 mg L- 1. Using picture analyses of polychaete movements, we showed that, paradoxically, an increase in SPM concentration did not adversely affect the feeding activity of S. alveolata since the number of filtering individuals remained stable from SPM = 6.5 to 55.5 mg L- 1. These values were applied at the scale of the bay of Mont-Saint-Michel (France) to demonstrate that the filtration pressure of large populations of wild suspension-feeders should not be underestimated when the carrying capacity has to be assessed in the context of increasing bivalve cultures. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Oyster production has historically taken place in intertidal zones, and shellfish farms already occupy large extents of the French intertidal space. The expansion of French shellfish aquaculture within intertidal areas is therefore spatially limited, and moving production to the subtidal offshore environment is considered to be a possible solution to this problem. Finding new sites along the French Atlantic coast was studied here from the perspective of small oyster companies run by young farmers, who are interested in offshore bivalve aquaculture expansion compatible with their investment capacity. In assessing the feasibility of such offshore production, we considered three main issues: (1) bivalve growth potential and (2) technical feasibility and conflicting uses, both within a spatial framework, as well as (3) the steps and barriers of the administrative licensing process. Oyster spat in an experimental offshore cage showed significantly faster growth, in terms of both weight and length, compared to those in an intertidal cage, mainly due to lower turbidity and full-time feeding capacity (i.e., constant immersion in the water). A combination of Earth Observation data and bivalve ecophysiological modelling was then used to obtain spatial distribution maps of growth potential, which confirmed that offshore sites have better potential for oyster growth than the traditionally oyster-farmed intertidal sites overall, but that this is highly spatially variable. Small-scale producers indicated two technical factors constraining where farms could be located: bathymetry must be between 5 and 20 m and the distance from a harbor no more than five nautical miles. These were included along with maps of various environmental and socio-economic constraints in a Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE). Touristic traffic and bottom trawling by fisherman were found to be the two other most restrictive variables. The GIS-based SMCE developed in this study showed that there is almost 400 km2 of highly- to very highly-suitable area within which to develop offshore aquaculture using simple, low-cost bottom-cage techniques, and can be used to assist the shellfish industry in the Marine Spatial Planning decision-making process, still in progress in this coastal area. However, the complexity of the administrative processes necessary to obtain an offshore license is perceived as a stronger barrier by farmers owning small companies than site selection, technical feasibility, and required investments, and will be crucial to address in order to realistically proceed to offshore cultivation. The process demonstrated here, and the results are relevant to other coastal and offshore locations throughout the world and can be adapted for other species.},

   abstract = {Very high-resolution satellite imagery (≤5 m resolution) has become available on a spatial and temporal scale appropriate for dynamic wetland management and conservation across large areas. Estuarine wetlands have the potential to be mapped at a detailed habitat scale with a frequency that allows immediate monitoring after storms, in response to human disturbances, and in the face of sea-level rise. Yet mapping requires significant fieldwork to run modern classification algorithms and estuarine environments can be difficult to access and are environmentally sensitive. Recent advances in unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS, or drones), coupled with their increased availability, present a solution. UAS can cover a study site with ultra-high resolution ( < 5 cm) imagery allowing visual validation. In this study we used UAS imagery to assist training a Support Vector Machine to classify WorldView-3 and RapidEye satellite imagery of the Rachel Carson Reserve in North Carolina, USA. UAS and field-based accuracy assessments were employed for comparison across validation methods. We created and examined an array of indices and layers including texture, NDVI, and a LiDAR DEM. Our results demonstrate classification accuracy on par with previous extensive fieldwork campaigns (93% UAS and 93% field forWorldView-3; 92% UAS and 87% field for RapidEye). Examining change between 2004 and 2017, we found drastic shoreline change but general stability of emergent wetlands. Both WorldView-3 and RapidEye were found to be valuable sources of imagery for habitat classification with the main tradeoff beingWorldView's fine spatial resolution versus RapidEye's temporal frequency. We conclude that UAS can be highly effective in training and validating satellite imagery.},

   abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The evolution of eutrophication (i.e., phytoplankton biomass) during recent decades was examined in the coastal waters of Vilaine Bay (VB, France) in relation to those in their main external nutrient sources, the Loire and Vilaine Rivers. Dynamic Linear Models, corroborated by the Mann-Kendall test, were used to study long-term trends and seasonality of dissolved inorganic nutrient and chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentrations (Chl <i>a</i>) in rivers and coastal waters between 1980 and 2013. The reduction in dissolved riverine inorganic phosphorus concentrations (DIP) from the early 1990s led to the decrease in their Chl <i>a</i> levels. However, dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations (DIN) decreased only slightly in the Vilaine and actually increased in the Loire, especially during summer. Simultaneously, phytoplankton in the VB has undergone profound changes with: (1) increase in biomass, (2) change in the position of the annual peak from spring to summer, and (3) increase in diatom:dinoflagellate ratios, especially in summer. The increase in phytoplankton biomass in VB, particularly in summer, was probably due to increased DIN loads from the Loire, sustained by internal regeneration of DIP and dissolved silicate from sediments. This long-term ecosystem-scale analysis reports the consequence of nutrient management scenarios focused solely on P reduction. Freshwater ecosystems upstream reveal successful recoveries through the control of P alone, while eutrophication continues to increase downstream, especially during the period of N limitation. Therefore, nutrient management strategies, paying particular attention to diffuse N-sources, are required to control eutrophication in receiving coastal waters.</p>},

These hard shores have natural advantages for scientists interested in intertidal ecology: they are usually accessible; the sessile organisms are easily observed; and the shores are relatively stable. However, the contrasts between sandy (non-cohesive) and muddy (cohesive) shores are equally of interest, although the shore themselves present more of a logistic challenge and hence contrasting accounts of the shores are less generally available. Also, except in the spe-cialised circumstance of sea grass meadows and mangals, the primary producers (microphytobenthos) that dominate depositional systems are far less obvious than the intertidal macro algae found on hard substrata.

We studied these relationships at both high (HT) and intermediate (IT) - turbidity sites, through historical data on water temperatures, multi-parameter environmental probes, histological analyses, and field collections of planktonic larvae and settled post-larvae in 2005 and 2006. A progressive warming trend was observed, especially since 1995, when oyster proliferation first became severe. Threshold temperatures for oocyte growth, larval development and settlement were achieved in both 2005 and 2006. The HT site showed greater numbers of larvae and post-larvae than the IT site for both years, with the highest numbers of post-larvae observed at both sites during the warmer summer of 2006. These results suggest that increased temperatures in northern European waters allow successful reproduction, larval development, and recruitment of C. gigas.

This consists of testing various atmospheric correction processors to remove the influence of atmosphere and comparing and developing chlorophyll a algorithms to estimate the ecological status of water in Estonian lakes. This study shows that the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument is suitable for estimating chlorophyll a in water bodies and tracking the spatial and temporal dynamics in the lakes. However, atmospheric corrections are sensitive to surrounding land and often fail in narrow and small lakes. Due to that, deriving satellite-based chlorophyll a is not possible in every case, but initial results show the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument could still provide complementary information to in situ data to support Water Framework Directive monitoring requirements.},

   abstract = {Loss on ignition (LOI) is a simple, inexpensive method widely used to estimate organic matter in the water column and sediment of marine and freshwater ecosystems. Suspended particulate matter in estuarine waters however often contains a large fraction of argillaceous minerals whose loss of structural water can introduce significant bias to the method. The accuracy of LOI, in comparison with elemental analysis, was evaluated in 105 water samples from the Marennes-Oléron Bay (French Atlantic coast). The suspended particulate matter analysed ranged from 7 to 108 mg l-1, with a mean inorganic fraction of 81.3 ± s.d. 7.2%. LOI overestimated particulate organic matter (POM) concentrations by up to 300% (mean 98 ± s.d. 28%), and this overestimation was significantly related to particulate inorganic matter (PIM) concentrations. POM overestimation increased linearly with PIM, representing a mean 8.7 ± s.d. 2.0% of PIM. This value was compared with a theoretical correction factor based on the specific clay composition of PIM at the study site and on thermo-gravimetric analysis for standard clay. The clay fraction, which represents 90% of PIM in the Marennes-Oléron Sound, consists of 40% illite, 30% kaolinite and 30% montmorillonite. The similarity between the theoretical correction factor (9.3% of PIM) and the overestimation based on measurements (8.7%), suggests that a priori correction of POM data is possible. In fact, for three bodies of water along the French Atlantic coast, whose inorganic resuspended matter shows the same mineralogical composition, POM concentrations as estimated by LOI can be corrected by subtracting 9.3% of PIM mass. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The traditional fattening of the oyster Crassostrea gigas in oyster ponds of the French Atlantic Coast is submitted to natural environmental fluctuations. In order to reduce the growth variability of the soft parts of the bivalve, an intensive fattening process was developed, where the conditions of temperature, particulate organic and inorganic matter (POM and PIM) are controlled. This process relies on the production of the diatom Skeletonema costatum, which is then distributed to the oysters at an average concentration of 4-5 mg POM·L-1. An ecophysiological model of the oyster C. gigas, which simulates the evolution of somatic and gonad-reserve compartments, was applied to these conditions in order to analyse the bivalve responses. Experimentation was performed to elaborate the model and two functions were studied: clearance rate and pseudofecal production. At a temperature of 14 °C, chosen for the fattening process, and at POM and PIM concentrations varying respectively from 4 to 18 mg·L-1 and 15 to 55 mg·L-1, it was found that clearance rate was not regulated (mean of 2.09 ± 0.11 L·h-1·g-1 with 59% of activity rate) and that ingestion rate depended on the production of pseudofeces. This production allows an increase of organic ingested fraction, by the mechanism of pre-ingestive selection that buffers the PIM variability. Negative effects of PIM on growth have been studied through several simulations. It appears that actual POM ration (4-5 mg·L-1) used in the fattening process, allows dry tissues growth, in spite of simulated PIM concentration up to 50 mg·L-1. The elaboration of the model revealed that gametogenesis is a major determinant in bivalve energy partitioning in the rich food conditions of this fattening process. © 2001 Ifremer/CNRS/Inra/IRD/Cemagref/Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.},

No difference was observed for total adductor muscle area. Intersite differences in the mean length of EFC and in the distance between two adjacent cirri sampled on ordinary filaments in the midregion of the gill were studied by image analysis. Cirri tended to be longer and more evenly spaced in oysters from the higher turbidity zone, although differences were not significant at the 5% probability level.

This bay is located at a latitude in the middle of the European range of the species, and is characterized by high concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and a marked gradient between high-turbidity sites in the north (daily SPM>500mgL-1) and intermediate-turbidity sites in the south. The models use two forcing variables: seawater temperature and food density. We tested two indices of food availability: chlorophyll a and microalgal concentrations. In the SFG model, food intake is simulated by a type-II Holling functional response, as in the DEB formulation, and the effect of turbidity in both models is therefore taken into account principally through the half-saturation coefficient for this functional response. Chlorophyll a concentrations were three to four times higher at the high-turbidity site, but oyster growth rates were significantly lower at this site than at the intermediate-turbidity site. A comparison of observed and simulated values showed that the DEB model performed better than the SFG model if microalgal concentration was used as an index of food availability, with the SFG model underestimating oyster growth in summer and autumn. However, the SFG model was much more efficient if chlorophyll a concentrations were used, with the DEB model systematically overestimating summer and autumn growth. This comparison suggests that both SFG and DEB simulations could be improved, to give a more accurate description of oyster growth in a turbid environment, and that the pre-ingestive selection mechanisms used by suspension feeders in turbid environments should probably be included in the formulation of feeding processes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, we modelled Ulva proliferation using a two-dimensional model by coupling hydrodynamic and biological models (coined 'MARS-Ulves') for five sites along the Brittany coastline (La Fresnaye Bay, Saint-Brieuc Bay, Lannion Bay, Guissény Bay and Douarnenez Bay). Calibration of the biological model was mainly based on the seasonal variation of the maximum nitrogen uptake rate (VmaxN) and the half-saturation constant for nitrogen (KN) to reproduce the internal nutrient quotas measured in situ for each site. In each bay, model predictions were in agreement with observed algal coverage converted into biomass. A numerical tracking method was implemented to identify the contribution of the rivers that empty into the study bays, and scenarios of decreases in nitrate concentration in rivers were simulated. Results from numerical nitrogen tracking highlighted the main nitrogen sources of green tides and also showed that each river contributes locally to green tides. In addition, dynamic modelling showed that the nitrate concentrations in rivers must be limited to between 5 and 15mgl-1, depending on the bay, to reduce Ulva biomass by half on the coasts. The three-step methodology developed in this study (analysing total dissolved inorganic nitrogen flux from rivers, tracking nitrogen sources in Ulva and developing scenarios for reducing nitrogen) provides qualitative and quantitative guidelines for stakeholders to define specific nitrogen reduction targets for better environmental management of water quality. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

However, their community structure and diversity remain poorly understood. We investigated the variability in their taxonomic composition and diversity over 5 years in a temperate tidal flat based on high-throughput sequencing of the rbcL gene. Chao1 and Shannon species richness and diversity estimates in this study ranged from 412 to 9582 and from 2.7 to 6.3, respectively, showing higher diversity than previous estimates based on traditional morphological analyses. At the genus level, Navicula, Nitzschia, and Amphora were dominant in all seasons. However, at the 98% identity operational taxonomic unit level, seasonal changes in community structure were remarkable. A number of taxa were found only during a specific season, and only a small portion of taxa were commonly found in all seasons. This seasonal succession was mainly influenced by sediment temperatures and sand ratios. Our research provides a solid basis for the high diversity of tidal flat diatoms.},

   abstract = {Bivalves have often been used in integrated fish-farming to enhance the economical value of by-products and/or to improve water quality. However, no physiological studies have dealt with the contribution of the two main sources of organic matter potentially present in a fish-farm effluent: living cells of phytoplankton and detritical matter (fish-faeces and uneaten feed). This study evaluated feeding responses of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) to a land-based fish-farm effluent comprised mainly of fish-faeces (Dicentrarchus labrax) and compared them with those obtained with a diatom (Skeletonema costatum). A particular distinction of the main sources of organic matter was made in the experiments, the two diets being evaluated separately and mixed. Feeding responses were evaluated using the biodeposit method with special attention being paid to pre-ingestive processes and absorption efficiency (AE). Experiments were carried out between May and July 1998 in the laboratory at constant water temperature (20°C). Results showed that food quality (nature of particulate organic matter, POM, organic content of the total suspended matter, TSM) had no influence on clearance rates. However, clearance rates were significantly reduced for oysters in advanced stage of gametogenesis. S. costatum was preferentially ingested compared to the fish-faeces when offered in a mixed diet. Absorption efficiency and energy content (56% and 15 J mg-1, respectively) of the fish-faeces were lower than those estimated for S. costatum (66-70%, 20 J mg-1). Nevertheless, these values were high for such a detritic type of food. This study confirms that both concepts of biomechanical filter and economical value improvement of fish-farming waste using oysters are of interest. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Cleve produced in nutrient-rich saline ground water. An episodic reduction in biomass production caused by an unidentified protozoon stressed the need to find new microalgal species as substitutes for S. costatum and diversify the microalgae used by the bivalve industry. Three species met the requirements for year-round availability in Bourgneuf Bay coastal waters and growth potential in saline ground water: Nitzschia acicularis (Kützing), Nitzschia closterium (Ehrenberg) Wm Smith and Nitzschia gandersheimiensis Krasske = Nitzschia tubicola Grunow. These microalgae were tested as food sources for adult Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) by comparing short-term bivalve physiological responses with those obtained with S. costatum as reference. Suspended particulate matter concentrations in experimental diets ranged from 9.3 to 18.6 mg l-1 and particulate organic matter concentrations from 3.3 to 5.7 mg l-1. Significant differences were observed, with clearance rates ranging from 4.0 1 h-1 g-1 for N. acicularis to 7.3 1 h-1 g-1 for N. gandersheimiensis. The filtration rate for organic matter was significantly higher for N. gandersheimiensis than the other species, but this algae was also significantly more rejected in pseudofaeces. No differences were found among the four mean faeces production rates. Net energy balance differed significantly among the four microalgae tested, ranging from 282 J h-1 g-1 for S. costatum to 27 J h-1 g-1 for N. closterium. However, no differences were found between S. costatum, N. acicularis and N. gandersheimiensis. These results suggest that N. acicularis and N. gandersheimiensis could be tested on a larger scale involving the production of microalgae in 50-m3 outdoor tanks in association with Pacific oyster growth experiments. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, we used phytoplankton occurrence data, from a French national phytoplankton monitoring network, and environmental variables with the aim of characterizing the realized ecological niches of phytoplankton groups. We selected 35 phytoplankton taxa representing the most important taxa in terms of occurrence frequency and abundance along the French coast of the eastern English Channel, the Southern Bight of the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. We show that environmental variables such as nutrient concentration, water temperature, irradiance and turbidity can be considered key factors controlling phytoplankton dynamics and influencing the community structure. By using a statistical framework based on an ordination technique the community structure was analyzed and interpreted in terms of niche overlap, marginality and tolerance. The most marginal taxon was Dactyliosolen and the most tolerant was Skeletonema. Non-marginal taxonomic units could be generalist and specialist, while marginal taxa were rather specialist. Specialist and marginal taxa globally showed lower values of overlap.},

   abstract = {The aim of this work is to assess the use of (SPOT) multispectral visible infrared remote sensing to study microphytobentos assemblages in a shellfish ecosystem (Bay of Bourgneuf, France). SPOT satellite images (acquired at low tide in spring or autumn between 1986 and 1998) were calibrated using in situ radiometric data, and the normalised vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from these images showed microphytobenthos on bay mudflats. Proliferation was mainly along a north-south strip, essentially localised around the +2 m isobath and covering a surface area of 19 to 25% of the total mudflat area studied (420 to 550 ha). Three factors seem to be responsible for the spatial structure of the assemblages: bathymetry, nutrient input from the Falleron River and its channel, and the location of oyster-farming areas. Although spatial and spectral resolutions of multispectral remote sensing data have certain limitations, this approach opens up a new field of application for hyperspectral remote sensing, particularly for synoptic mapping of biomass distribution. © 2003 Académie des sciences.

Seagrass meadows form highly productive and valuable ecosystems in the marine environment. Throughout the year, seagrass meadows are exposed to abiotic and biotic variations linked to (i) seasonal fluctuations, (ii) short-term stress events such as, e.g., local nutrient enrichment, and (iii) small-scale disturbances such as, e.g., biomass removal by grazing. We hypothesized that short-term stress events and small-scale disturbances may affect seagrass chance for survival in temperate latitudes. To test this hypothesis we focused on seagrass carbon reserves in the form of starch stored seasonally in rhizomes, as these have been defined as a good indicator for winter survival. Twelve Zostera noltei meadows were monitored along a latitudinal gradient in Western Europe to firstly assess the seasonal change of their rhizomal starch content. Secondly, we tested the effects of nutrient enrichment and/or biomass removal on the corresponding starch content by using a short-term manipulative field experiment at a single latitude in the Netherlands. At the end of the growing season, we observed a weak but significant linear increase of starch content along the latitudinal gradient from south to north. This agrees with the contention that such reserves are essential for regrowth after winter, which is more severe in the north. In addition, we also observed a weak but significant positive relationship between starch content at the beginning of the growing season and past winter temperatures. This implies a lower regrowth potential after severe winters, due to diminished starch content at the beginning of the growing season. Short-term stress and disturbances may intensify these patterns, because our manipulative experiments show that when nutrient enrichment and biomass loss co-occurred at the end of the growing season, Z. noltei starch content declined. In temperate zones, the capacity of seagrasses to accumulate carbon reserves is expected to determine carbon-based regrowth after winter. Therefore, processes affecting those reserves might affect seagrass resilience. With increasing human pressure on coastal systems, short- and small-scale stress events are expected to become more frequent, threatening the resilience of seagrass ecosystems, particularly at higher latitudes, where populations tend to have an annual cycle highly dependent on their storage capacity.},

   abstract = {This paper discusses the pre-launch spectral characterization of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) at the component, assembly and instrument levels and relates results of those measurements to artifacts observed in the on-orbit imagery. It concludes that the types of artifacts observed and their magnitudes are consistent with the results of the pre-launch characterizations. The OLI in-band response was characterized both at the integrated instrument level for a sampling of detectors and by an analytical stack-up of component measurements. The out-of-band response was characterized using a combination of Focal Plane Module (FPM) level measurements and optical component level measurements due to better sensitivity. One of the challenges of a pushbroom design is to match the spectral responses for all detectors so that images can be flat-fielded regardless of the spectral nature of the targets in the imagery. Spectral variability can induce striping (detector-to-detector variation), banding (FPM-to-FPM variation) and other artifacts in the final data products. Analyses of the measured spectral response showed that the maximum discontinuity between FPMs due to spectral filter differences is 0.35% for selected targets for all bands except for Cirrus, where there is almost no signal. The average discontinuity between FPMs is 0.12% for the same targets. These results were expected and are in accordance with the OLI requirements. Pre-launch testing identified low levels (within requirements) of spectral crosstalk amongst the three HgCdTe (Cirrus, SWIR1 and SWIR2) bands of the OLI and on-orbit data confirms this crosstalk in the imagery. Further post-launch analyses and simulations revealed that the strongest crosstalk effect is from the SWIR1 band to the Cirrus band; about 0.2% of SWIR1 signal leaks into the Cirrus. Though the total crosstalk signal is only a few counts, it is evident in some scenes when the in-band cirrus signal is very weak. In moist cirrus-free atmospheres and over typical land surfaces, at least 30% of the cirrus signal was due to the SWIR1 band. In the SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands, crosstalk accounts for no more than 0.15% of the total signal.},

Sea water samples were collected every hours to evaluate time-related variations of phytoplankton concentrations and to compare the relative ratio of A. catenella versus other phytoplankton species during the outbreak. From these observations, trials using recirculated sea water systems were performed to: i) evaluate the physiological effects on oyster of increasing proportions of A. catenella within a mixed microalgal diet where the non-toxic diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii was present at concentration: 1500 cells ml-1, ii) compare the effect of two temperatures (12 °C and 18 °C) on paralytic toxin accumulation rates in oyster flesh by ion-pairing high performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC) detection, iii) analyse toxin biotransformation during the contamination process, iv) evaluate the role of the different types of oyster tissue on the bioaccumulation mechanism. The results showed: i) a significant effect of temperature increase on clearance rate and toxin uptake, ii) no detectable time-related effects of toxic algal food on pre-ingestion sorting or on toxin profiles in oyster flesh, iii) either negative or positive effects of A. catenella concentrations on toxin uptake ("threshold" effect), iv) high amounts of toxins in the digestive gland, accounting for more than 80% of overall shellfish toxicity. The daily amount of toxins (Qtox) taken up by each oyster was evaluated by means of a global one-compartment model. However a two-compartment model finally gave the best match with real contamination kinetics, since it integrated both toxins sequestered in oyster tissues and toxins moving in through the digestive tract. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2007.},

   abstract = {© The Author 2017. Pre-ingestive selection has been identified as a feeding mechanism of oysters that may influence their uptake of particles and microalgal cells. Oysters can feed specifically on the pennate diatom Haslea ostrearia, which produces the blue pigment marennine that is responsible for the greening of oysters. Because the size of particles or cells plays a significant role in the selection process, and given that diatoms experience a decrease in size as a consequence of vegetative reproduction, H. ostrearia consumption and marennine uptake might be influenced by pre-ingestive selection. We examined the role of H. ostrearia cell size in the selective feeding of Crassostrea gigas. Individual flow-Through chambers were used to deliver mixtures of H. ostrearia of varying cell length to oysters. Inflow, outflow and pseudofaecal samples were collected from chambers during oyster feeding. Video-endoscopy was used to sample material in the dorsal and ventral particle tracts. Diatom cells counts showed that pseudofaeces contained on average larger cells than the ambient medium. However, proportions of the different populations of H. ostrearia in pseudofaeces were identical to those in the ventral tracts, indicating that no selection was performed by the labial palps. Video-endoscopy, plus imaging by scanning electron microscopy, of gills and labial palps revealed that only those larger H. ostrearia that were orientated dorsoventrally could enter the principal filaments (pfs) and then access the dorsal acceptance tract. These results show that for particles like Haslea cells with only one axis exceeding the width of the pfs, the selection on the oyster gills is passive and based on cell size.},

   abstract = {The occurrence of new phytoplankton species in a coastal area may be explained by the import of shellfish containing whole live algal cells in their digestive tracts. Indeed, shellfish containing toxic algal cells can induce both primary contaminations in safe areas (initially free from toxic microalgae), and secondary contaminations of other shellfish growing in the same area via the faeces of the imported animals. To mitigate this problem, shellfish need to be placed in a separate holding tank and their intestinal content purged. For a deeper understanding of the risks associated with transferring contaminated shellfish, oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and mussels (Mytilus edulis) were purposely fed either Alexandrium minutum or A. catenella (Dinophyceae) or Pseudo-nitzschia calliantha (Bacillariophyceae) toxic algae for 2 h. They were then transferred into individual tanks where they were continuously fed with a non-toxic alga, Tetraselmis suecica. Biodeposit production, faeces composition, and filtration rates were monitored for the shellfish over a 6-h period. The effect of temperature differences and different initial toxic algae concentrations were compared. This study revealed a relationship between temperature and cell lysis in the oyster digestive tract. It also indicated that toxic algae concentration did not seem to influence gut passage time in oysters, while a significant effect was observed in mussels, and confirmed the existence of a difference between oyster and mussel feeding patterns. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2008.},

The goals of this study were to investigate the seasonal variations of metabolism, to estimate daily potential primary production variation at the annual scale and to estimate the annual potential primary production of the mudflat. Primary production and respiration were estimated by in situ measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes. Chlorophyll a concentration exhibited a great variability on both locations. Gross community production ranged from ca. 0 to 77 mg C m-2 h-1 at the muddy-sand location and from ca. 0 to 122 mg C m-2 h-1 at the muddy location. Community respiration showed a seasonal trend following temperature variations (up to 28.51 mg C m-2 h-1 in the muddy-sand and up to 23.40 mg C m-2 h-1 in the mud). Daily potential primary production was calculated, according to seasonal variations of photosynthetic parameters calculated using three photosynthesis versus irradiance curves obtained for the muddy location. The annual gross community primary production was 135 g C m-2 yr-1, leading to a low autotrophic annual budget, considering an annual community respiration of 110 g C m-2 yr-1. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Since 1950, increase in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) river loadings in the North-East Atlantic (NEA) continental seas has induced a deep change in the marine coastal ecosystems, leading to eutrophication symptoms in some areas. In order to recover a Good Ecological Status (GES) in the NEA, as required by European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), reductions in N- and P-river loadings are necessary but they need to be minimal due to their economic impact on the farming industry. In the frame of the “EMoSEM” European project, we used two marine 3D ecological models (ECO-MARS3D, MIRO&CO) covering the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel and the southern North Sea to estimate the contributions of various sources (riverine, oceanic and atmospheric) to the winter nitrate and phosphate marine concentrations. The various distributed descriptors provided by the simulations allowed also to find a log-linear relationship between the 90th percentile of satellite-derived chlorophyll concentrations and the “fully bioavailable” nutrients, i.e. simulated nutrient concentrations weighted by light and stoichiometric limitation factors. Any GES threshold on the 90th percentile of marine chlorophyll concentration can then be translated in maximum admissible ‘fully bioavailable’ DIN and DIP concentrations, from which an iterative linear optimization method can compute river-specific minimal abatements of N and P loadings. The method has been applied to four major river groups, assuming either a conservative (8 μg Chl L−1) or a more socially acceptable (15 μg Chl L−1) GES chlorophyll concentration threshold. In the conservative case, maximum admissible winter concentrations for nutrients correspond to marine background values, whereas in the lenient case, they are close to values recommended by the WFD/MSFD. Both models suggest that to reach chlorophyll GES, strong reductions of DIN and DIP are required in the Eastern French and Belgian-Dutch river groups.},

   abstract = {Random Forests receive much attention from researchers because of their excellent performance. As Breiman suggested, the performance of Random Forests depends on the strength of the weak learners in the forests and the diversity among them. However, in the literature, many researchers only considered pre-processing of the data or post-processing of the Random Forests models. In this paper, we propose a new method to increase the diversity of each tree in the forests and thereby improve the overall accuracy. During the training process of each individual tree in the forest, different rotation spaces are concatenated into a higher space at the root node. Then the best split is exhaustively searched within this higher space. The location where the best split lies decides which rotation method to be used for all subsequent nodes. The performance of the proposed method here is evaluated on 42 benchmark data sets from various research fields and compared with the standard Random Forests. The results show that the proposed method improves the performance of the Random Forests in most cases. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The cultural ecosystem services of coastal ecosystems are generally underappreciated, and this is particularly the case when quantifying their scientific value. We created a tiered set of indicators to quantify scientific value spatially, and tested them using the case study of the island nation of Singapore. We conducted a systematic review of research papers, book chapters, conference reports and academic theses produced across 10 coastal ecosystems in Singapore, including mangroves, seagrasses, coral reefs, beaches and artificial coastal structures. At least 656 articles have been produced on Singapore's coastal zone, with 2201 unique observations, showing that scientific value is spatially variable along Singapore's coastline. Novel indicators such as the Site Impact Factor are able to differentiate scientific value between sites. This method has shed light on an under-recognised, but important cultural ecosystem service, and is applicable to other spatially-bounded coastal, marine and terrestrial landscapes.},

   abstract = {According to requirements for intercalibration of assessment methods of vegetation quality elements along the North East Atlantic region, within the scope of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), a better classification system of coastal regions is needed. To accomplish that goal, a quantitative classification approach was launched in order to establish common typologies for assessment of this biological quality element. This was preliminarily based on a physical classification of the coastal waters that included two consecutive steps, a first one devoted to the establishment of "biotypes" (large areas), and a latter one dealing with recognition of the variability within biotypes (" subtypological variants"). The NEA region coastline was subdivided into 550 consecutive stretches (40 km long). Then, physical variables (sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, wave exposure, tidal range and salinity) were calculated in reference points of each stretch, 5. km from the coast. This information was based mostly on satellite acquired data, using specific procedures proposed in this work. Physical typologies of NEA coastal waters were obtained by statistical analyses. Five different biotypes were selected (i.e. coastal sectors of the European coast) by national experts as baseline information to be used on intercalibration of assessment methods for vegetation within the WFD. Variability of environmental conditions on those biotypes was also analyzed and compared with previous classifications carried out at the national scale. Results from this study showed the feasibility of this methodological approach as a useful tool for assessment of the actual homogeneity of coastal environments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The objectives of this study were: (a) to generate an intertidal digital elevation model (DEM) using waterlines extracted from Landsat TM and in situ ground levelling data; (b) to quantitatively estimate morphologic change from the generated DEMs for the years 1991 and 2000; and (c) to evaluate the chenier migration in the tidal flats of Gomso Bay, Korea. On extracting the waterlines, we considered the tidal flat environments, such as tidal conditions, remnant surface water, suspended sediment, and exposure time. Ground levelling was carried out along one line in 1991, and two lines in 2000. From the extracted waterlines and ground levelling data, we succeeded in generating intertidal DEMs with an accuracy of 10.9 cm r.m.s. overall, and 7.3 cm r.m.s. in the lower tidal flats. The morphologic changes estimated by subtracting the two DEMs showed an erosion rate of -9.0 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to an annual mean morphologic change budget of -309,865 m3/yr. Overall, the Gomso tidal flats can be defined as an erosion-dominant environment. The changes with respect to the sedimentary facies were also evaluated as: (a) the sandy silt flat had a sedimentation rate of -3.4 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to an annual mean budget of -52,552 m3/yr; (b) the silty sand flat had a sedimentation rate of -14.3 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to a mean erosion of -197,927 m3/yr; and (c) the sand flat had a sedimentation rate of -11.8 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to a mean change of -58,808 m3/yr. The results comply with the general rules of sedimentology. We also investigated the chenier migration, which is the most dynamic geomorphologic change in the tidal flats. Chenier is usually composed by sand and shell as a result of coastal progradation in sand, and it is dominantly fed by sediments transported by long-shore currents. The chenier was found to have migrated about 148 m landward over 6 yr. The results demonstrate that satellite remote sensing is an efficient and effective tool for a long-term morphologic change estimation in tidal flats. © 2008.},

These tidal flats play a critical role in coastline protection and biodiversity conservation, and against storm surges, but have recently been displaying drastic changes in geomorphic dynamics because of human activities. However, a comprehensive understanding of spatiotemporal changes in tidal flats in RSRs remains lacking. Hence, we employed a novel remote sensing method by obtaining the instantaneous high/low tide line positions from over 112 scenes of Landsat satellite images of the study area from 1975 to 2017, which were used to track the recent evolution of the coastal tidal flats in the modern RSRs over the past four decades. We found that the shoreline of the tidal flats showed an advanced seaward trend, and the waterline of the tidal flat presented a gradual process during different periods. The total tidal flat area in the study area showed an obviously decreasing trend overall, and approximately 992 km2 of the tidal flat was lost. We also found that the coastal tidal flats in the modern RSRs were generally undergoing erosion in the low tidal flats, especially in the Northern Swing and Southern Swing areas, while the high tidal flats showed a slowed accretionary change. Land reclamation was the main factor affecting the reduction in the tidal flat area, as the reclamation area has increased by 1300 km2, with an average of 35.14 km2 /year. In addition, the erosion of the tidal flats was associated with a reduced sediment supply. Our findings will provide useful information for local managers and researchers to support future environmental management because increasing demand for land and rising sea levels are expected in the future.},

All Sentinel-2 MSI bands but the blue and red parts of the spectrum recorded by the sensor, provided negative but significant correlation results with growing stock volume. The use of traditional vegetation indices did not improve the strength of the correlation. The Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI) were found to have the strongest correlation for the retrieval of GSV. The replacement of the Near InfraRed (NIR) band in the indices formula with the first rededge band improved the magnitude of the relationship significantly. The information content of Sentinel-2 MSI imagery was also found to be slightly higher compared to the Landsat-8 OLI imagery based on the results of the Random Forest regression algorithm that was used to model the relationship between the spectral information inherent in both sensors and the GSV.},

   abstract = {A Random Forest (RF) classifier was applied to spectral as well as mono- and multi-seasonal textural features extracted from Landsat TM imagery to increase the accuracy of land cover classification over a complex Mediterranean landscape, with a large number of land cover categories and low inter-class separability. Five different types of geostatistical textural measure for three different window sizes and three different lags were applied creating a total of 972 potential input variables. Madograms, rodograms and direct variograms for the univariate case and cross- and pseudo-cross variograms for the multivariate case, together with multi-seasonal spectral information, were used in a RF classifier to map the land cover types. The pseudo-cross and cross variograms were used specifically to incorporate important seasonal/temporal information. Incorporating multi-scale textural features into the RF models led to an increase in the overall index of 10.71% and, for the most accurate classification, the increase was up to 30% in some classes. The differences in the kappa coefficient for the textural classification models were evaluated statistically using a pairwise Z-test, revealing a significant increase in per-class classification accuracy compared to GLCM-based texture measures. The pseudo-cross variogram between the visible and near-infrared bands was the most important textural features for general classification, and the multi-seasonal pseudo-cross variogram had an outstanding importance for agricultural classes. Overall, the RF classifier applied to a reduced subset of input variables composed of the most informative textural features led to the highest accuracy. Highly reliable classification results were obtained when the 16 most important textural features calculated at single scales (window sizes) were selected and used in the classification. The proposed methodology significantly increased the classification accuracy achieved with a spectral maximum likelihood classifier (ML). The kappa values for the textural RF and ML classifications were equal to 0.92 and 0.83, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Coastal wetlands in China are changing quickly due to land reclamation, aquaculture, industrialization, and urbanization. However, accurate and updated maps of coastal wetlands (including vegetation and tidal flats) in China are unavailable, and the detailed spatial distribution of coastal wetlands is unknown. Here, we developed a new pixel- and phenology-based algorithm to identify and map coastal wetlands in China for 2018 using time series Landsat imagery (2798 ETM+/OLI images) and the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The resultant map had a very high overall accuracy (98%). There were 7474.6 km2 of coastal wetlands in China in 2018, which included 5379.8 km2 of tidal flats, 1856.4 km2 of deciduous wetlands, and 238.3 km2 of evergreen wetlands. Jiangsu Province had the largest area of coastal wetlands in China, followed by Shandong, Fujian, and Zhejiang Provinces. Our study demonstrates the high potential of time series Landsat images, pixel- and phenology-based algorithm, and GEE for mapping coastal wetlands at large scales. The resultant coastal wetland maps at 30-m spatial resolution serve as the most current dataset for sustainable management, ecological assessments, and conservation of coastal wetlands in China.},

Moreover, reference to historical maps suggests that up to 65% of tidal flats were lost over the past five decades.

In this review, we assess how ecologists have selected, used, and evaluated the performance of the indicator species. We reviewed all articles published in Ecological Indicators (EI) between January 2001 and December 2014, focusing on the number of indicators used (one or more); common taxa employed; terminology, application, and rationale behind selection criteria; and performance assessment methods. Over the last 14 years, 1914 scientific papers were published in EI, describing studies conducted in 53 countries on six continents; of these, 817 (43%) used biological organisms as indicators. Terms used to describe organisms in IS research included "ecological index", "environmental index", "indicator species", "bioindicator", and "biomonitor," but these and other terms often were not clearly defined. Twenty percent of IS publications used only a single species as an indicator; the remainder used groups of species as indicators. Nearly 50% of the taxa used as indicators were animals, 70% of which were invertebrates. The most common applications behind the use of IS were to: monitor ecosystem or environmental health and integrity (42%); assess habitat restoration (18%); and assess effects of pollution and contamination (18%). Indicators were chosen most frequently based on previously cited research (40%), local abundance (5%), ecological significance and/or conservation status (13%), or a combination of two or more of these reasons (25%). Surprisingly, 17% of the reviewed papers cited no clear justification for their choice of indicator. The vast majority (99%) of publications used statistical methods to assess the performance of the selected indicators. This review not only improves our understanding of the current uses and applications of IS, but will also inform practitioners about how to better select and evaluate ecological indicators when conducting future IS research.},

We developed an ecosystem-specific, multiscale spatial model to synthesize 17 global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change for 20 marine ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that no area is unaffected by human influence and that a large fraction (41%) is strongly affected by multiple drivers. However, large areas of relatively little human impact remain, particularly near the poles. The analytical process and resulting maps provide flexible tools for regional and global efforts to allocate conservation resources; to implement ecosystem-based management; and to inform marine spatial planning, education, and basic research.},

   abstract = {Land cover mapping for large regions often employs satellite images of medium to coarse spatial resolution, which complicates mapping of discrete classes. Class memberships, which estimate the proportion of each class for every pixel, have been suggested as an alternative. This paper compares different strategies of training data allocation for discrete and continuous land cover mapping using classification and regression tree algorithms. In addition to measures of discrete and continuous map accuracy the correct estimation of the area is another important criteria. A subset of the 30 m national land cover dataset of 2006 (NLCD2006) of the United States was used as reference set to classify NADIR BRDF-adjusted surface reflectance time series of MODIS at 900 m spatial resolution. Results show that sampling of heterogeneous pixels and sample allocation according to the expected area of each class is best for classification trees. Regression trees for continuous land cover mapping should be trained with random allocation, and predictions should be normalized with a linear scaling function to correctly estimate the total area. From the tested algorithms random forest classification yields lower errors than boosted trees of C5.0, and Cubist shows higher accuracies than random forest regression.},

   abstract = {This paper describes a new methodology to map intertidal sediment using a commercially available unmanned aerial system (UAS). A fixed-wing UAS was flown with both thermal and multispectral cameras over three study sites comprising of sandy and muddy areas. Thermal signatures of sediment type were not observable in the recorded data and therefore only the multispectral results were used in the sediment classification. The multispectral camera consisted of a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) camera and four multispectral sensors covering the green, red, red edge and near-infrared bands. Statistically significant correlations ( > 99%) were noted between the multispectral reflectance and both moisture content and median grain size. The best correlation against median grain size was found with the near-infrared band. Three classification methodologies were tested to split the intertidal area into sand and mud: k-means clustering, artificial neural networks, and the random forest approach. Classification methodologies were tested with nine input subsets of the available data channels, including transforming the RGB colorspace to the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) colorspace. The classification approach that gave the best performance, based on the j-index, was when an artificial neural network was utilized with near-infrared reflectance and HSV color as input data. Classification performance ranged from good to excellent, with values of Youden's j-index ranging from 0.6 to 0.97 depending on flight date and site.},

   abstract = {The spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrasses have been studied from the leaf to patch (100m2) scales. However, landscape scale (>100km2) seagrass population dynamics are unresolved in seagrass ecology. Previous remote sensing approaches have lacked the temporal or spatial resolution, or ecologically appropriate mapping, to fully address this issue. This paper presents a robust, semi-automated object-based image analysis approach for mapping dominant seagrass species, percentage cover and above ground biomass using a time series of field data and coincident high spatial resolution satellite imagery. The study area was a 142km2 shallow, clear water seagrass habitat (the Eastern Banks, Moreton Bay, Australia). Nine data sets acquired between 2004 and 2013 were used to create seagrass species and percentage cover maps through the integration of seagrass photo transect field data, and atmospherically and geometrically corrected high spatial resolution satellite image data (WorldView-2, IKONOS and Quickbird-2) using an object based image analysis approach. Biomass maps were derived using empirical models trained with in-situ above ground biomass data per seagrass species. Maps and summary plots identified inter- and intra-annual variation of seagrass species composition, percentage cover level and above ground biomass. The methods provide a rigorous approach for field and image data collection and pre-processing, a semi-automated approach to extract seagrass species and cover maps and assess accuracy, and the subsequent empirical modelling of seagrass biomass. The resultant maps provide a fundamental data set for understanding landscape scale seagrass dynamics in a shallow water environment. Our findings provide proof of concept for the use of time-series analysis of remotely sensed seagrass products for use in seagrass ecology and management. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The derivation, performance, sensitivity and inherent uncertainty of ecological quality indicators have become major topics in developing tools for the management of marine, transitional and coastal waters. In reviewing the advances in these waters, related to an ecological status assessment, we show the future challenges to be addressed within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Using new analyses carried out under the research project 'Water Bodies in Europe: Integrative Systems to Assess Ecological status and Recovery', we provide a complete set of assessments for the biological quality elements (BQEs) (phytoplankton, macroalgae-seagrasses, macroinvertebrates and fish) to be assessed, as well as the validation of existing indicators and multimetric indices and, in some cases, the development of new assessment indices. We show that these indices respond differently to different human pressures and they each have challenges in defining reference conditions against which future changes are judged. In investigating good ecological potential, as the response to heavily modified water bodies, we show that there are flaws in the Directive, not least in its definitions. Our analyses have also focussed on uncertainty in using the indices and we emphasise the problems of defining ecological class boundaries based on indices which themselves may be combined indices (multimetrics). The analysis shows that some of those multimetrics are redundant and/or are inter-correlated and thus may reduce the sensitivity in defining ecological class boundaries. If this is related to the drivers-pressures-state change-impacts-response approach then there are lessons for management measures aimed at achieving good ecological status and even the potential for legal challenges to decisions based on uncertain indices under the WFD. Hence, we conclude the continued need for advances in assessing pressures and gradients, and defining reference conditions for state change, index development, impact assessment and the validation of indices for each BQE. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

However, only the Specific Pollution Sensitivity Index (SPI), the Generic Diatom Index (GDI) and the Commission of Economical Community Index (CEC) show significant correlations with the ionic strength (expressed by chlorides, sulphates and conductivity) and eutrophication (expressed by chlorophyll and nitrates). Diatom indices do not integrate chemical parameters in the same way. Best correlations are obtained through simultaneous or average chemical analyses whereas for other parameters, best correlations are noted with chemical analyses carried out just before diatom sampling.

   abstract = {In the frame of the Copernicus programme, ESA has developed and launched the Sentinel-2 optical imaging mission that delivers optical data products designed to feed downstream services mainly related to land monitoring, emergency management and security. The Sentinel-2 mission is the constellation of two polar orbiting satellites Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, each one equipped with an optical imaging sensor MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument). Sentinel-2A was launched on June 23 rd , 2015 and Sentinel-2B followed on March 7 th , 2017. With the beginning of the operational phase the constellation of both satellites enable image acquisition over the same area every 5 days or less. To use unique potential of the Sentinel-2 data for land applications and ensure the highest quality of scientific exploitation, accurate correction of satellite images for atmospheric effects is required. Therefore the atmospheric correction processor Sen2Cor was developed by Telespazio VEGA Deutschland GmbH on behalf of ESA. Sen2Cor is a Level-2A processor which main purpose is to correct single-date Sentinel-2 Level-1C Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) products from the effects of the atmosphere in order to deliver a Level-2A Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance product. Additional outputs are an Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) map, a Water Vapour (WV) map and a Scene Classification (SCL) map with Quality Indicators for cloud and snow probabilities. Telespazio France and DLR have teamed up in order to provide the calibration and validation of the Sen2Cor processor. Here we provide an overview over the Sentinel-2 data, processor and products. It presents some processing examples of Sen2Cor applied to Sentinel-2 data, provides up-to-date information about the Sen2Cor release status and recent validation results at the time of the SPIE Remote Sensing 2017.},

   abstract = {The global decline in estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) is affecting a number of critical benefits, or ecosystem services. We review the main ecological services across a variety of ECEs, including marshes, mangroves, nearshore coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sand beaches and dunes. Where possible, we indicate estimates of the key economic values arising from these services, and discuss how the natural variability of ECEs impacts their benefits, the synergistic relationships of ECEs across seascapes, and management implications. Although reliable valuation estimates are beginning to emerge for the key services of some ECEs, such as coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangroves, many of the important benefits of seagrass beds and sand dunes and beaches have not been assessed properly. Even for coral reefs, marshes, and mangroves, important ecological services have yet to be valued reliably, such as cross-ecosystem nutrient transfer (coral reefs), erosion control (marshes), and pollution control (mangroves). An important issue for valuing certain ECE services, such as coastal protection and habitat–fishery linkages, is that the ecological functions underlying these services vary spatially and temporally. Allowing for the connectivity between ECE habitats also may have important implications for assessing the ecological functions underlying key ecosystems services, such coastal protection, control of erosion, and habitat–fishery linkages. Finally, we conclude by suggesting an action plan for protecting and/or enhancing the immediate and longer-term values of ECE services. Because the connectivity of ECEs across land–sea gradients also influences the provision of certain ecosystem services, management of the entire seascape will be necessary to preserve such synergistic effects. Other key elements of an action plan include further ecological and economic collaborative research on valuing ECE services, improving institutional and legal frameworks for management, controlling and regulating destructive economic activities, and developing ecological restoration options.},

   abstract = {Seagrass ecosystems are highly sensitive to environmental change. They are also in global decline and under threat from a variety of anthropogenic factors. There is now an urgency to establish robust monitoring methodologies so that changes in seagrass abundance and distribution in these sensitive coastal environments can be understood. Typical monitoring approaches have included remote sensing from satellites and airborne platforms, ground based ecological surveys and snorkel/scuba surveys. These techniques can suffer from temporal and spatial inconsistency, or are very localised making it hard to assess seagrass meadows in a structured manner. Here we present a novel technique using a lightweight (sub 7 kg) drone and consumer grade cameras to produce very high spatial resolution (∼4 mm pixel−1) mosaics of two intertidal sites in Wales, UK. We present a full data collection methodology followed by a selection of classification techniques to produce coverage estimates at each site. We trialled three classification approaches of varying complexity to investigate and illustrate the differing performance and capabilities of each. Our results show that unsupervised classifications perform better than object-based methods in classifying seagrass cover. We also found that the more sparsely vegetated of the two meadows studied was more accurately classified - it had lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between observed and classified coverage (9–9.5%) compared to a more densely vegetated meadow (RMSD 16–22%). Furthermore, we examine the potential to detect other biotic features, finding that lugworm mounds can be detected visually at coarser resolutions such as 43 mm pixel−1, whereas smaller features such as cockle shells within seagrass require finer grained data (<17 mm pixel−1).},

Diatoms were collected from the upper 5 mm of sediments at 60 sites along eight transect lines running perpendicular to the shore line. Of the 371 taxa encountered in the study area, 88% were pennate diatoms. Genera represented by the greatest number of species were Navicula, Nitzschia, Amphora, Cocconeis, Fragilaria and Achnanthes. The most abundant species were Paralia sulcata, Navicula sp. #1, N. arenaria and Cymatosira belgica; all were broadly distributed across the tidal flats. The 60 sites could be assigned to eight clusters with respect to similarity in species composition. Discriminant analysis showed that separation cluster was primarily related to the mean grain size of the sediment. The species could not be separated into groups based on similarities in occurrence; a high degree of spatial overlap was observed. The preferences of the more abundant species for grain size were, therefore, analysed by plotting numerical abundance against mean grain size. There were at least four patterns: species groups could be associated with finegrained sediments, those of intermediate size and coarser sediments and the last group showed no discernible pattern. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Technical advancements have widened the limits of remote sensing in mapping shallow water benthic habitats and bathymetry over the last decades. On the other hand, the needs of shallow water remote sensing have pushed instrument development. In this manuscript we provide 50-year retrospective of the developments in the field in terms of both instrumentation and methods. We also show that spectral features characteristic of the main benthic groups in shallow water are consistent from the tropics to sub-arctic regions and from salty to freshwaters. The fundamental limiting factor in both benthic mapping and bathymetry is absorption of light by water molecules. However, spectral absorption by water molecules is the key to bathymetry derivation. Variable backscattering by particles and absorption by dissolved organic matter is a confounding factor for all objectives. The combination of using the spectral and textural characteristics of bottom features and our knowledge about these features have now resulted in the ability to map habitats over large coastal systems. This manuscript has shown that optically shallow water remote sensing has reached levels where the satellite derived bathymetry and habitat maps are accepted by different end users (including the International Maritime Organisation) and are routinely used in ecological studies, monitoring and management of coastal environments.},

   abstract = {Knowledge of tree species distribution is important worldwide for sustainable forest management andresource evaluation. The accuracy and information content of species maps produced using remotesensing images vary with scale, sensor (optical, microwave, LiDAR), classification algorithm, verificationdesign and natural conditions like tree age, forest structure and density. Imaging spectroscopy reducesthe inaccuracies making use of the detailed spectral response. However, the scale effect still has a stronginfluence and cannot be neglected. This study aims to bridge the knowledge gap in understanding thescale effect in imaging spectroscopy when moving from 4 to 30 m pixel size for tree species mapping,keeping in mind that most current and future hyperspectral satellite based sensors work with spatialresolution around 30 m or more.Two airborne (HyMAP) and one spaceborne (Hyperion) imaging spectroscopy dataset with pixel sizesof 4, 8 and 30 m, respectively were available to examine the effect of scale over a central European forest.The forest under examination is a typical managed forest with relatively homogenous stands featuringmostly two canopy layers. Normalized digital surface model (nDSM) derived from LiDAR data was usedadditionally to examine the effect of height information in tree species mapping. Six different sets ofpredictor variables (reflectance value of all bands, selected components of a Minimum Noise Fraction(MNF), Vegetation Indices (VI) and each of these sets combined with LiDAR derived height) were exploredat each scale. Supervised kernel based (Support Vector Machines) and ensemble based (Random Forest)machine learning algorithms were applied on the dataset to investigate the effect of the classifier. Iterativebootstrap-validation with 100 iterations was performed for classification model building and testing forall the trials.For scale, analysis of overall classification accuracy and kappa values indicated that 8 m spatial res-olution (reaching kappa values of over 0.83) slightly outperformed the results obtained from 4 m forthe study area and five tree species under examination. The 30 m resolution Hyperion image producedsound results (kappa values of over 0.70), which in some areas of the test site were comparable withthe higher spatial resolution imagery when qualitatively assessing the map outputs. Considering inputpredictor sets, MNF bands performed best at 4 and 8 m resolution. Optical bands were found to be best for30 m spatial resolution. Classification with MNF as input predictors produced better visual appearanceof tree species patches when compared with reference maps. Based on the analysis, it was concludedthat there is no significant effect of height information on tree species classification accuracies for thepresent framework and study area. Furthermore, in the examined cases there was no single best choiceamong the two classifiers across scales and predictors. It can be concluded that tree species mappingfrom imaging spectroscopy for forest sites comparable to the one under investigation is possible withreliable accuracies not only from airborne but also from spaceborne imaging spectroscopy datasets. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Fully Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) has the advantages of all-weather, day and night observation and high resolution capabilities. The collected data are usually sorted in Sinclair matrix, coherence or covariance matrices which are directly related to physical properties of natural media and backscattering mechanism. Additional information related to the nature of scattering medium can be exploited through polarimetric decomposition theorems. Accordingly, PolSAR image classification gains increasing attentions from remote sensing communities in recent years. However, the above polarimetric measurements or parameters cannot provide sufficient information for accurate PolSAR image classification in some scenarios, e.g. in complex urban areas where different scattering mediums may exhibit similar PolSAR response due to couples of unavoidable reasons. Inspired by the complementarity between spectral and spatial features bringing remarkable improvements in optical image classification, the complementary information between polarimetric and spatial features may also contribute to PolSAR image classification. Therefore, the roles of textural features such as contrast, dissimilarity, homogeneity and local range, morphological profiles (MPs) in PolSAR image classification are investigated using two advanced ensemble learning (EL) classifiers: Random Forest and Rotation Forest. Supervised Wishart classifier and support vector machines (SVMs) are used as benchmark classifiers for the evaluation and comparison purposes. Experimental results with three Radarsat-2 images in quad polarization mode indicate that classification accuracies could be significantly increased by integrating spatial and polarimetric features using ensemble learning strategies. Rotation Forest can get better accuracy than SVM and Random Forest, in the meantime, Random Forest is much faster than Rotation Forest.},

   abstract = {Point clouds generated from airborne oblique images have become a suitable source for detailed building damage assessment after a disaster event, since they provide the essential geometric and radiometric features of both roof and façades of the building. However, they often contain gaps that result either from physical damage or from a range of image artefacts or data acquisition conditions. A clear understanding of those reasons, and accurate classification of gap-type, are critical for 3D geometry-based damage assessment. In this study, a methodology was developed to delineate buildings from a point cloud and classify the present gaps. The building delineation process was carried out by identifying and merging the roof segments of single buildings from the pre-segmented 3D point cloud. This approach detected 96% of the buildings from a point cloud generated using airborne oblique images. The gap detection and classification methods were tested using two other data sets obtained with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images with a ground resolution of around 1-2. cm. The methods detected all significant gaps and correctly identified the gaps due to damage. The gaps due to damage were identified based on the surrounding damage pattern, applying Gabor wavelets and a histogram of gradient orientation features. Two learning algorithms - SVM and Random Forests were tested for mapping the damaged regions based on radiometric descriptors. The learning model based on Gabor features with Random Forests performed best, identifying 95% of the damaged regions. The generalization performance of the supervised model, however, was less successful: quality measures decreased by around 15-30%.},

Although consumers are abundant in most systems, the effect of trophic interactions on pattern formation in primary producers remains unstudied. We studied the effects of top-down control by herbivores on a self-organized landscape of regularly spaced, diatom-covered hummocks alternating with water-filled hollows on an intertidal mudflat in The Netherlands. Spatial patterns developed during spring but were followed by a rapid collapse in summer, leading to a flat landscape with low diatom densities and little variation in sediment bed level. This dramatic decline co-occurred with a gradual increase of benthic herbivores. A manipulative field experiment, where benthic herbivores were removed from the sediment, revealed that both diatom growth and hummock formation were inhibited by the activity of benthic herbivores. Our study provides clear evidence of top-down control of spatial selforganized patterns by benthic herbivores within a biological-geomorphic landscape. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Coastal meadows worldwide are subjected to habitat degradation due to abandonment, intensification and the impacts of global change. In order to protect and restore these habitats and ensure the supply of valuable ecosystem services, it is necessary to know the extent and location of plant communities in coastal meadows. In this study, five plant communities were mapped at very high resolution in three different study sites in West Estonia. A fixed wing UAV was used to obtain multispectral images and derive a set of vegetation indices. Two different image classification techniques were used to cluster the vegetation indices maps and produce plant community distribution maps. The highest classification accuracy was obtained using a Random Forest classifier and 13 vegetation indices. Additionally, the spectral characteristics of the training samples were correlated with aboveground biomass and species diversity. Both biomass and species diversity were positively correlated with the spectral diversity of training samples and are thus likely to have an effect on the classification accuracy. The results of this study highlight the need to utilize a wide array of vegetation indices and assess the spectral characteristics of training samples in order to obtain high classification accuracies and understand the nature of misclassification errors. The resulting maps provide a solid foundation for global change impact assessment and habitat management and restoration in coastal meadows.},

The main objective of this study was to investigate microphytobenthic biomass and photosynthetic performances as a function of the sedimentary and environmental variabilities in the range of intertidal habitats in the downstream Seine estuary (Normandy, France). Our results highlight higher biomass associated with more stratified biofilms and better photosynthetic performances in areas characterized by a sand/mud mixture (40-60% of mud) compared to pure sand or pure mud environments. This type of sediment probably offers an efficient trade-off between the favorable characteristics of the two types of sediments (sand and mud) with respect to light penetration and nutrient accessibility. Moreover, the large quantities of exopolysaccharides produced in sand/mud mixtures emphasizes the functional role played by microphytobenthos in promoting sediment stability against erosion. This allows us to show that despite the strong increase in sand content of the downstream Seine estuary, intertidal flats are still productive since microphytobenthic biomass, photosynthetic performances and exopolysaccharides secretion are highest in sand-mud mixtures. This study also underlines the impact of ecosystem modifications due to human disturbance and climate change on the dynamics of key primary producers in estuaries.},

The selected FS algorithms, correlation-based feature selection, mean decrease in accuracy, random forest (RF) based recursive feature elimination, and variable selection using random forest, were tested on the extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, RF, and recursive partitioningclassifiers, respectively. The results demonstrate that the selection of an appropriate FS method can be crucial to the performance of a machine learning classifier in terms of accuracy but also parsimony. In this scope, we propose a new metric to perform model selection named classification optimization score (COS) that rewards model simplicity and indirectly penalizes for increased computational time and processing requirements using the number of features for a given classification model as a surrogate. Our findings suggest that applying rigorous FS along with utilizing the COS metric may significantly reduce the processing time and the storage space while at the same time producing higher classification accuracy than using the initial dataset.},

The spectral reflectance of fouled and unfouled leaf samples collected from marine and brackish habitats at three estuaries in southeastern Australia were measured in the field with a spectroradiometer during each season in 1999 and 2000. Seagrass species were spectrally distinct regardless of whether the leaves were fouled by epibionts and despite spatial and temporal variability in the reflectance of each species. The visible wavelengths that penetrate water coincide with the regions of maximum absorption and characteristic reflectance by plant photosynthetic and accessory pigments. Strong and consistent differences in reflectance between species were recorded in the green wavelengths at 530-580 nm with additional discrimination in the regions 520-530 nm and 580-600 nm and at the red chlorophyll absorption trough at 686-700 nm. Species discrimination should be possible in the remote sensing of benthic aquatic vegetation using a hyperspectral sensor that has narrow bands centered on pigment-related spectral features in the visible wavelengths. The detection of statistically significant differences in intraspecific reflectance associated with the year, season, estuary, and habitat of sample collection suggests a potential for monitoring seagrass health and estuarine water quality. This study has produced the first spectral library of aquatic plant species to take into account the range of spectral variability expected for the species under natural conditions. The results provide a sound basis for future mapping of seagrass species in Australia.},

   abstract = {Arrays of vertically aligned single crystalline Si nanowires (NWs) decorated with arbitrarily shaped Si nanocrystals (NCs) have been fabricated by a silver assisted wet chemical etching method. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy are performed to measure the dimensions of the Si NWs as well as the Si NCs. A strong broad band and tunable visible (2.2 eV) to near-infrared (1.5 eV) photoluminescence (PL) is observed from these Si NWs at room temperature (RT). Our studies reveal that the Si NCs are primarily responsible for the 1.5-2.2 eV emission depending on the cross-sectional area of the Si NCs, while the large diameter Si/SiOx NWs yield distinct NIR PL consisting of peaks at 1.07, 1.10 and 1.12 eV. The latter NIR peaks are attributed to TO/LO phonon assisted radiative recombination of free carriers condensed in the electron-hole plasma in etched Si NWs observed at RT for the first time. Since the shape of the Si NCs is arbitrary, an analytical model is proposed to correlate the measured PL peak position with the cross-sectional area (A) of the Si NCs, and the bandgap (Eg) of nanostructured Si varies as Eg = Eg (bulk) + 3.58 A-0.52. Low temperature PL studies reveal the contribution of non-radiative defects in the evolution of PL spectra at different temperatures. The enhancement of PL intensity and red-shift of the PL peak at low temperatures are explained based on the interplay of radiative and non-radiative recombinations at the Si NCs and Si/SiOx interface. Time resolved PL studies reveal bi-exponential decay with size correlated lifetimes in the range of a few microseconds. Our results help to resolve a long standing debate on the origin of visible-NIR PL from Si NWs and allow quantitative analysis of PL from arbitrarily shaped Si NCs. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Accurate habitat mapping methods are urgently required for the monitoring, conservation, and management of blue carbon ecosystems and their associated services. This study focuses on exposed intertidal seagrass meadows, which play a major role in the functioning of nearshore ecosystems. Using Sentinel-2 (S2) data, we demonstrate that satellite remote sensing can be used to map seagrass percent cover (SPC) and leaf biomass (SB), and to characterize its seasonal dynamics. In situ radiometric and biological data were acquired from three intertidal meadows of Zostera noltei along the European Atlantic coast in the summers of 2018 and 2019. This information allowed algorithms to estimate SPC and SB from a vegetation index to be developed and assessed. Importantly, a single SPC algorithm could consistently be used to study Z. noltei-dominated meadows at several sites along the European Atlantic coast. To analyze the seagrass seasonal cycle and to select images corresponding to its maximal development, a two-year S2 dataset was acquired for a French study site in Bourgneuf Bay. The potential of S2 to characterize the Z. noltei seasonal cycle was demonstrated for exposed intertidal meadows. The SPC map that best represented seagrass growth annual maximum was validated using in situ measurements, resulting in a root mean square difference of 14%. The SPC and SB maps displayed a patchy distribution, influenced by emersion time, mudflat topology, and seagrass growth pattern. The ability of S2 to measure the surface area of different classes of seagrass cover was investigated, and surface metrics based on seagrass areas with SPC ≥ 50% and SPC ≥ 80% were computed to estimate the interannual variation in the areal extent of the meadow. Due to the high spatial resolution (pixel size of 10 m), frequent revisit time (≤ 5 days), and long-term objective of the S2 mission, S2-derived seagrass time-series are expected to contribute to current coastal ecosystem management, such as the European Water Framework Directive, but to also guide future adaptation plans to face global change in coastal areas. Finally, recommendations for future intertidal seagrass studies are proposed.},

   abstract = {A study of the particulate organic carbon (POC) in the estuarine turbidity maxima (ETMs) of the three major French macrotidal estuaries shows that the average contents are 1.5, 3.3 and 3.1% (expressed in % of dry suspended sediment) in the Gironde, Loire and Seine Estuaries, respectively. There is no seasonal variation of POC contents in the Gironde Estuary, whereas, they often increase in the Loire and the Seine Estuaries in spring and summer. The lability of the estuarine particulate organic matter was estimated by two analyses: 1/labile organic matter was measured as the organic carbon loss during incubation tests over one month; 2/ the hydrolysable organic fraction was determined after 6N HCl digestion. The organic fractions of the ETMs are mainly refractory. Any increase in the amount of POC as compared to the background levels (cited above) is always correlated to an increase of organic matter lability. The yearly average fluvial contributions by various particulate organic pools (soil and litter organic matter; organic matter of phytoplanktonic and human origin) that enter the three estuaries were quantified. In the Garonne River, soil and litter are the major (90%) POC sources. In the Loire system, due to the eutrophication of the river water, phytoplankton contributes up to 50% of the total POC load. In the Seine river, soil and litter contribute 70% of the total POC input; POC of human origin is also significant (10%), due to the impact of the City of Paris (10 million inhabitants). The lability of the different types of organic matter ranks as follows: phytoplankton ∼litter > human-origin organic matter >> soil. By combining the POC budgets and the lability of each type of organic fraction, it was possible to explain why the POC of the three ETMs is different and characterizes its refractory vs. labile nature. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {Aim Concerns over how global change will influence species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis on understanding niche dynamics in evolutionary and community contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences between or within taxa. We propose a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data. Location Europe, North America and South America. Methods The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species. Results We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geographical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space to multivariate environmental space independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space. However, the use of ordination and species distribution model techniques for selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrasting results. Main conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographical distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {The design and objective of a community study imply the selection of the appropriate ordination technique in terms of species response models and weighting options. In this paper, we start from the observation that existing two-table ordination techniques and related measures of niche breadth inevitably weight a sample in proportion to its abundance. We introduce a new multivariate method, which gives a more even weight to all sampling units, including those which are species poor or individual poor. We use this new method of analysis which we call OMI (for Outlying Mean Index) to address the question of niche separation and niche breadth. The Outlying Mean Index, or species marginality, measures the distance between the mean habitat conditions used by species (species centroid), and the mean habitat conditions of the sampling area (origin of the niche hyperspace), and OMI analysis places species along habitat conditions using a maximization of their mean OMI. Therefore, the position of the species depends on their niche deviation from a reference, which represents neither the mean nor the most abundant species, but a theoretical ubiquitous species that tolerates the most general habitat conditions (i.e., a hypothetical species uniformly distributed among habitat conditions). We demonstrate that OMI analysis is well suited for the investigation of multidimensional niche breadths in the case of strong limiting factors (e.g., meteorological conditions) or strong driving forces (e.g., longitudinal stream gradient). Furthermore, the analysis helps in finding which ecological factors are most important for community structure and organization and provides a separation of species based on their niche characteristics.},

   abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) is composed of unicellular photosynthetic organisms that colonize intertidal sediments within the first millimeters of the photic zone and form biofilms at low tide. In estuaries, this benthic group can represent the main primary producer and deliver several ecosystem services. However, it is not currently used as a bioindicator of water quality, contrary to the widespread use of phytobenthos in freshwater settings. This study assesses the potential of developing MBP metrics to assess water quality in transitional waters using Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery. A Random Forest machine learning classification was used to distinguish different types of intertidal vegetation in 26 French estuaries and bays, in particular MPB and green macroalgae (chlorophytes), using multispectral indices. High accuracy was generally achieved for the identification of MPB when compared with field validation data, for both User's and Producer's accuracies, which corresponded to 94% and 84% respectively. Two Earth observation variables were retrieved: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy of MPB biomass, and MPB percent cover integrated over the entire intertidal area of the water body. From a total of 918 S2 images from over a full year, 28% were exploitable due to the combined requirements of cloud-free pixels collected during low tide. With its 10 m spatial resolution, S2 was able to map all estuaries. MPB percent cover showed a stronger gradient between estuaries than MPB NDVI. MPB percent cover was also significantly correlated with green macroalgae percent cover, and a group of estuaries characterized by the highest MPB and green macroalgae coverage corresponded to eutrophic sites impacted by intensive farming activities. A multivariate analysis confirmed that MPB percent cover was indeed related to nutrients. It was also related to sediment type which was one of the main factors underlying differences between estuaries. This work is a first step toward a water quality metric using MPB, and several recommendations are proposed to refine this approach. Sentinel-2 imagery, which is publicly available, presents an interesting compromise to map estuarine microphytobenthos in order to assess the ecological status of transitional waters.},

   abstract = {Coastal and estuarine nursery grounds are essential habitats for sustaining flatfish stocks since only these shallow and productive areas provide the high food supply that allows maximizing juvenile growth and survival in most flatfish species. However, the main organic matter sources at the basis of benthic food webs might differ drastically between estuarine nursery grounds under strong freshwater influences, where food webs are mainly supported by continental organic matter, and coastal ecosystems under limited freshwater influence, where the local marine primary production is the main source of carbon for the benthos. To better understand the links between continental inputs to the coastal zone and stock maintenance in the highly prized common sole, Solea solea (L.), we investigated the variability in the organic matter sources supporting the growth of its young-of-the-year (YoY) in five contrasted estuarine and coastal nursery grounds under varying freshwater influence. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen allowed tracing the origin of the organic matter exploited by YoY soles in the very first months following their benthic settlement, i.e. when most of the juvenile mortality occurs in the species. A mixing model was run to unravel and quantify the contribution of all major potential sources of organic matter to sole food webs, with a sensitivity analysis allowing assessment of the impact of various trophic enrichment factors on model outputs. This meta-analysis demonstrated a relative robustness of the estimation of the respective contributions of the various organic matter sources. At the nursery scale, the upstream increase in freshwater organic matter exploitation by YoY soles and its positive correlation with inter-annual variations in the river flow confirmed previous conclusions about the importance of organic matter from continental origin for juvenile production. However, inter-site differences in the organic matter sources exploited for growth showed that, although freshwater organic matter use is significant in all nursery sites, it is never dominant, with especially high contributions of local primary production by microphytobenthos or saltmarsh macrophytes to juvenile sole growth in tidal nursery ecosystems. These patterns stress the need for maintaining both the intensity of freshwater inputs to the coastal zone and of local autochthonous primary production (especially that of the intertidal microphytobenthos) to preserve the nursery function of coastal and estuarine ecosystems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Flood magnitudes of those documentary events were estimated at four sites (Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera and Alcántara) along the Tagus River using HEC-RAS Computer program, matching the calculated water surface profiles with historical references of flood stage. The largest floods took place during the periods AD 1168-1211 (Toledo and Talavera), AD 1658-1706 (Talavera), AD 1870-1900, and AD 1930-1950 (Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera and Alcántara). The temporal distribution of flood magnitude and frequency is discussed within the context of climatic variability experienced by the Iberian Peninsula. Although flood producing mechanisms of Atlantic and Mediterranean basins of the Iberian Peninsula are related to different, independent atmospheric patterns, there is a clear coincidence between most periods showing high flood frequencies. These periods of high flooding seem to correspond to the initial and final decades of periods with climate deterioration described at the continental scale. This suggests that climatic variability over the last millennium has induced a response in hydrological extremes (positive or negative), irrespective of the flood-producing mechanism.},

In this review, the relationship between the distribution of carotenoids and the phylogeny of oxygenic phototrophs in sea and fresh water, including cyanobacteria, red algae, brown algae and green algae, is summarized. These phototrophs contain division- or class-specific carotenoids, such as fucoxanthin, peridinin and siphonaxanthin. The distribution of α-carotene and its derivatives, such as lutein, loroxanthin and siphonaxanthin, are limited to divisions of Rhodophyta (macrophytic type), Cryptophyta, Euglenophyta, Chlorarachniophyta and Chlorophyta. In addition, carotenogenesis pathways are discussed based on the chemical structures of carotenoids and known characteristics of carotenogenesis enzymes in other organisms; genes and enzymes for carotenogenesis in algae are not yet known. Most carotenoids bind to membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, such as reaction center, light-harvesting and cytochrome b 6f complexes. Water-soluble peridinin-chlorophyll a-protein (PCP) and orange carotenoid protein (OCP) are also established. Some functions of carotenoids in photosynthesis are also briefly summarized. © 2011 by the authors.},

Estimates of global seagrass spatial distribution differ greatly throughout the published literature, ranging from 177 000 to 600 000 km2 with models suggesting potential distribution an order of magnitude higher. The requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement by outlining National Determined Contributions (NDC's) to reduce emissions is placing an increased global focus on the spatial extent, loss and restoration of seagrass meadows. Now more than ever there is a need to provide a more accurate and consistent measure of the global spatial distribution of seagrass. There is also a need to be able to assess the global spread of other seagrass ecosystem services and in their extension, the values of these services. In this study, by rationalising and updating a range of existing datasets of seagrass distribution around the globe, we have estimated with Moderate to High confidence the global seagrass area to date as 160 387 km2, but possibly 266 562 km2 with lower confidence. We break this global estimate down to a national level with a detailed analysis of the current state of mapped distribution and estimates of seagrass area per country. Accurate estimates, however, are challenged by large areas remaining unmapped and inconsistent measures being used. Through the examination of current global maps, we are able to propose a pathway forward for improving mapping of this important resource.

   abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management.},

The extension was done, firstly, by using dual-copolarization SAR data acquired at shorter wavelengths (C- and X-band, in addition to the previously used L-band) and, secondly, by adding indicators derived from the (polarimetric) Kennaugh elements. The performance of the newly developed classification scheme, herein abbreviated as FCDK-RF, was tested using SAR data of exposed intertidal flats. We demonstrate that the FCDK-RF scheme is capable of distinguishing between different sediment types, namely mud and sand, at high spatial accuracies. Moreover, the classification scheme shows good potential in the detection of bivalve beds on the exposed flats. Our results show that the developed FCDK-RF scheme can be applied for the mapping of sediments and habitats in the Wadden Sea on the German North Sea coast using multi-frequency and multi-polarization SAR from ALOS-2 (L-band), Radarsat-2 (C-band) and TerraSAR-X (X-band).</p>},

   abstract = {Phytoplankton and microphytobenthos are important components of estuarine ecosystems. In this review we discuss the factors known to influence the photosynthesis, primary production and biomass of these two groups of primary producers, and the application of new techniques. . There is a large interplay of variables influencing the rate ot phytoplankton photosynthesis (nutrient or light limitation, osmotic str~ss) and factors ~n.nuencing biomass like grazing, washout, resuspensIOn and depositIOn. Phytoplankton in estuaries may experience rapid changes in the type of limitation (nutrients, light) and different physical environments (mixing, salinity), and these changes may int1uence species composition. Interannual variability in primary production can to a large extent be explained by changing weather conditions and changing land use, as the watershed and rainfall determine the nutrient and sediment input into estuaries. These inputs can both stimulate primary production when the system is nutrient limited or when the light conditions improve due to vertical density stratification, or it can decrease' primary production as sediment-laden water can decrease the light availability or flush out populations. There is a wealth of evidence that, due to increased land use and the concomitant increasing nutrient load, many estuaries have undergone eutrophication. The effect may to a large extent be dampened out when grazing by suspension feeders is important, as might have been the case in the Eastern Scheidt estuary, but other estuaries have shown signs that eutrophication might lead to the development of hannful algal blooms. Even in this case, total primary production will not necessarily change (in the case ?f turbid systems), but the changes in concentration and nutrient ratios might mfluence species composition, and it is important to realize that changes in the dominant species can have ecological implications. Thus, in order to understand ecosystem functioning better, we need to be able to understand what determines phytoplankton species composition and successio,n during blooms, what happens when blooms decay, how contaminants influence bloom dynamics and what is the interplay between nutrient enrichment and hannful algal blooms. These questions should preferably be addressed in integrated research programmes. .

   abstract = {River-dominated estuaries (also known as salt-wedge or highly stratified estuaries) are transitional water bodies occurring in micro-tidal coasts such as the Mediterranean. Their hydrological and ecological particularities make difficult the assessment of the ecological status using either the procedures for rivers or estuaries. For instance, river-dominated estuaries become rivers when the discharge is higher than its annual average (riverine conditions), whereas they become highly stratified when discharge is lower than its annual average (estuarine conditions). Moreover, the transition between riverine and estuarine conditions is abrupt and irregular across space and time, converting these transitional water bodies in naturally stressed ecosystems. To add more complexity, the human intervention in river basins (i.e. damming and intensive water use) has tended to reduce and homogenise river discharge, making more frequent and regular the presence of a salt wedge in the estuary, softening their natural stressful dynamics. As a result, it is difficult to discern natural from anthropogenic stressors, because the increase in environmental stability leads to higher complexity in biological communities and thus some bioindicators may show scores indicating better ecological status under impacted conditions than under natural conditions, which is an expression of a phenomenon known as â€˜estuarine quality paradoxâ€™. To sort out this situation and achieve a proper assessment of the ecological status of river-dominated estuaries, a specific approach is required, both in terms of the bioindicators to be used and the methodology to make them work in the correct way.},

   abstract = {The spatio-temporal variation of microphytobenthos (MPB) at the scale of a large estuary (Tagus estuary, Portugal) was studied using a combination of field and satellite remote sensing data during 2003. This is the first attempt to use remote sensing to study MPB in an ecosystem with a Mediterranean-like climate. Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) images were used to map benthic microalgae through the application of a Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI). A significant relationship between in-situ benthic chlorophyll a measurements and SPOT NDVI values was used to derive a map for biomass spatial distribution.At the scale of the whole intertidal area, NDVI time-series from 2003 revealed that MPB showed clear temporal variations, with lower values observed in summer compared to winter. This seasonal trend was found both in the SPOT and MERIS images and may be the result of extreme high temperatures that inhibit MPB growth. The main MPB biofilms were spatially stable through time at a large scale. Maximum NDVI values during the winter were found in the high shore with decreasing NDVI values towards the low shore. MPB light limitation at the lowest bathymetries is likely to occur in winter due to the high turbidity of Tagus estuary.The biomass spatial distribution map, obtained for January 2003, indicated low values ranging from 0 to 20mgChl am-2 for the lower shores, while in the upper shore biomass varied between 60 and 80mg Chlam-2. This study suggests striking differences in MPB seasonal patterns between the northern and southern European estuaries and stresses the need for ecophysiological approaches to investigate the role of thermo- and photo-inhibition as structuring factors for MPB biomass distribution. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {investigations were carried out on an intertidal sandflat (Kandalaksha Gulf, the White Sea, Kuss~a) during the summers of 1988 to 1992. Analysis of samples collected from areas of different sizes furn~shed information on the distribution of microphytobenthic organisms (diatoms and dinofla-gellates) over 3 spatial scales: microscale (10 to 1000 cm2), mesoscale (1000 cm2 to 100 m2) and macroscale (100 to 10000 m?). Analyses of the data disclosed the aggregated character of distribution on all spatial scales for the majority of dominating microalgal species and the existence of 2 orders of aggregation. The spatial structures formed by aggregates of the first and second orders are noticeably different from each other in the degree of aggregation (Cassie Index of 0.5 and > 2 on average, respectively), overlapping of species distributions (Pianka Index of 0.5 and 0.3 on average) and degree of sim-ilanty of species structure (Pianka Index of 0.9 and 0 5 on average). This indicates the existence of several structural associations on the studied intertidal sandflat which differed from each other in species composition and the character of spatial distribution of organisms. The studied community had a highly complicated spatial structure. The presence of several orders of aggregation probably results from several main biotic (interspecies interaction) and abiotic (granulometric composition of sediments and emersion period during low tide) factors. The degree of influence of these factors on the character of spatial d~stribution of microalgae is related to the selected spatial scale.},

   abstract = {Abstract In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi‐species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others, Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often‐quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self‐consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically‐relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example ‘sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C’. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non‐parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.

   abstract = {The natural diets of the introduced suspension-feeders Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) and Crepidula fornicata (L.) were determined at a mid-latitudinal oyster-farming site within their European range (Bourgneuf Bay, France). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope deviations of Pacific oysters and slipper limpets were compared with potential food sources on 3 sampling dates (March, July and November 2003). Four end-members were assimilated by the 2 species: C  3  angiosperm detritus, macroalgae-C 4  plant detritus, marine phytoplankton and benthic diatoms. Given the lack of source digestibility data for suspension-feeders, and these 2 species in particular, extreme feasible combinations of relative end-member contributions were calculated according to 2 assimilation scenarios, using either IsoSource software or a concentration-dependent model. For both Crassostrea gigas and Crepidula fornicata, benthic and planktonic microalgae dominated diets on the 3 sampling dates. Planktonic microalgae were ingested in greater proportions than benthic species in July and November; however, benthic diatoms also formed a constant and significant part of diets in these months, and were consumed in greater proportions than planktonic species in March. Plant (especially macroalgal) detritus played a major role in the diets of the 2 suspension-feeders, notably in March 2003 when it became the principal ingested source. The substantial contribution of plant detritus to the natural diets of these species has not previously been reported. Although Crassostrea gigas and Crepidula fornicata showed significantly different isotopic deviations in March and July 2003, trophic niches of Crassostrea gigas and Crepidula fornicata overlapped on all 3 sampling dates, with a greater ingestion of identical sources in November. These 2 invasive species could therefore be trophic competitors in the context of end-member supply limitation. Contrary to previous analyses conducted on these 2 species in Europe, this study reports significant dietary overlap. Ecosystem-specific diet studies of invasive species are thus necessary in order to understand trophic overlap/ competition as a function of the diversity and availability of local food sources. © Inter-Research 2007.},

   abstract = {Most studies of phytoplankton dynamics in lowland rivers have been conducted in regulated rivers. This study deals the phytoplankton of the River Loire, a relatively unregulated river in Western Europe, and aims at investigating the factors controlling phytoplankton composition and dynamics in this river. Phytoplankton biodiversity was assessed by pooling data from monthly sampling for 8 years at different sites. A correspondence analysis showed temporal and longitudinal gradients, with a dominance of small centric diatoms and green algae for most of the year, in the middle and lower river sectors. Phytoplankton dynamics were further explored using the POTAMON simulation model, run for the year 2005. The simulations, in agreement with the observations, confirmed the virtual absence of a Stephanodiscus spring peak, and reproduced well the development of small centric diatoms and green algae. Production and loss rates calculated by the model helped us to explain the dynamics of the three main phytoplankton categories, which attained high net production rates due to the low river depth (âˆ¼1 m at low discharge), but were subject to high sedimentation losses. Model calculations also showed that P limitation was likely, particularly for green algae, with a reduction of growth rate of up to 35%. In addition, the simulations showed a significant impact of the invasive Asian clam, Corbicula spp., on phytoplankton biomass. This study shows that the factors determining phytoplankton diversity and dynamics in this unregulated river are basically the same as those identified in other lowland rivers, but that key factors are habitat diversity and variation of water level in the river channel.},

In this study, a 12-year phytoplankton time-series was used to investigate the contribution of benthic microalgae to the pelagic system at a site along the French-Atlantic coast. Furthermore, all taxa identified were allocated into different growth forms in order to study their seasonal patterns. The highest contribution of benthic microalgae was observed during the winter period, reaching up to 60% of the carbon biomass in the water column. The haptobenthic growth form showed the highest contribution in terms of biomass, dominant in the fall-winter period when the turbidity and the river flow were high. The epipelic growth form did not follow any seasonal pattern. The epiphytic diatom Licmophora was most commonly found during summer. As benthic microalgae were found in the water column throughout the year, the temporal variation detected in the structure of pelagic assemblages in a macrotidal ecosystem was partly derived from the differentiated contribution of several benthic growth forms.},

   abstract = {The microphytobenthos form an important component of all shallow-water ecosystems where enough light reaches the sediment surface to support appreciable primary production. Although less conspicuous than macroalgae or vascular plants, the microphytobenthos can contribute significantly to primary production and can modify habitat characteristics. The microphytobenthos alter sediment properties (e.g., erodibility) both directly, in the extreme forming a mat or scum on the sediment surface, and indirectly by modifying the activities of benthic infauna (e.g., pelletization, burrowing, tube building, and sediment tracking). Carbon dioxide fixed by the microphytobenthos supports higher, grazing trophic levels. These include deposit-feeding and suspension-feeding macrofauna as well as meiofauna and microfauna. Quantitative relations between the feeding and growth rates of macrofauna and the abundance of microphytobenthos and suspended organic matter (i.e., functional responses) are reviewed. Given the current state of knowledge of the direct and indirect interactions involving trophic dynamics, sediment properties, and benthic microalgae, we argue for reductionist studies of particular interactions as distinct entities. This is a prerequisite for the emergence of a comprehensive picture of unvegetated ecosystems and the ability to predict their responses to man's activities.},

Early morning biofilms consisted of smaller naviculoid and nitzschioid taxa or euglenoid species. By midday, Gyrosigma balticum and Pleurosigma angulatum were dominant. Some taxa (e.g., Plagiotropis vitrea) disappeared from surface layers after midday. Species composition continued to change toward the end of the photoperiod, with G. balticum dominating in diatom-rich biofilms. In Euglena-rich biofilms, initial dense surface films of euglenids became progressively dominated by smaller diatoms. F′q/ F′m (measured at a photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD) of 220 μmol m-2 s-1) of individual cells of all taxa declined significantly after midday, but increased toward dusk. There were significant differences in F′q/F′m between species, particularly after midday. F′q/ F′m versus irradiance curves and relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) showed higher efficiencies and rETRmax for euglenids, whereas G. balticum, Nitzschia dubia, and small Nitzschia sp. were shade-adapted with low values of F′q/Fm′, rETRmax, and Esat. G. balticum, P. vitrea, and N. dubia showed rapid vertical migration away from the surface with increasing irradiance. Euglenids, P. angulatum, and N. dubia exhibited their highest rETRmax values at midday. Esat for algal cells was between 500 and 600 μmol m-2 s-1, except for N. dubia and small Nitzschia sp., which had an Esat of 300 μmol m-2 s-1. Differences in behavioral and photophysiological traits between microphytobenthic taxa could be a form of niche separation and need to be incorporated into conceptual models of daily patterns of production in intertidal biofilms. © 2005, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

   abstract = {Long-term trends in the phytoplankton community along the French coast of the English Channel and southern Bight of the North Sea were studied and related to physico-chemical factors and large-climatic indices. Phytoplankton and hydrological data were acquired through three transects. Sampling took place between 1992 and 2011 as part of the French Phytoplankton Monitoring Network (REPHY) and the Regional Nutrients Monitoring Network (SRN). Trends in time-series were identified with dynamic linear models tailored to environmental monitoring data characteristics (e.g. irregular sampling frequency, missing data). Temporal and spatial patterns in the phytoplankton community were explained with a partial triadic analysis. Relationships between the phytoplankton community composition, environmental factors, and climatic indices were assessed using a redundancy analysis (RDA). The analyses revealed long-term changes in the community composition, characterized by a temporal structure that remained common to all transects. The abundance of some groups of taxa such as the one composed by Gymnodinium and Gyrodinium, as well as the group of Pseudo-nitzschia increased during the study period, whereas the abundance of other taxa as for example Guinardia and the group of Coscinodiscus and Stellarima globally decreased. More generally, the proportion of dinoflagellates relative to diatoms increased. Trends in environmental variables were also observed in most sites and related to decreases in nutrient concentrations and an increasing trend in salinity. The RDA indicated that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index and salinity were the main factors defining the temporal structure of the phytoplankton community. This suggests that variations observed in the phytoplankton community are linked to hydro-climatic changes in the coastal environment.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Microphytobenthos (MPB) from intertidal mudflats are key primary producers at the land-ocean interface. MPB can be more productive than phytoplankton and sustain both benthic and pelagic higher trophic levels. The objective of this study is to assess the contribution of light, mud temperature, and gastropod Peringia ulvae grazing pressure in shaping the seasonal MPB dynamics on the Brouage mudflat (NW France). We use a physical-biological coupled model applied to the sediment first centimeter for the year 2008. The simulated data compare to observations including time-coincident remotely sensed and in situ data. The model suggests a MPB annual cycle characterized by a main spring bloom, a biomass depression in summer, and a moderate fall bloom. In early spring, high simulated photosynthetic rates due to mud surface temperature (MST) values close to the MPB temperature optimum for photosynthesis and to increasing solar irradiance trigger the onset of the MPB spring bloom. After the bloom, high MST values lead to synoptic events when MPB thermo-inhibition (39.5% of summer) and limitation by P. ulvae grazing (8.7% of summer) superimpose. During these synoptic events of thermo-inhibition and grazing combination, 14% of the simulated annual MPB primary production is channeled towards the P. ulvae secondary production through ingestion. The model suggests that such a combined effect is highly linked to the MPB biomass depression in summer. The model ability to infer on biotic and abiotic mechanisms driving the seasonal MPB dynamics could open the door to a new assessment of the export flux of biogenic matter at the land-ocean interface and, more generally, of the contribution of productive intertidal biofilms to the coastal carbon cycle.},

   abstract = {This study presents an innovative approach to map microphytobenthos biomass and fractional cover in Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast) using Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS) hyperspectral data. Microphytobenthos is a microalgae forming a biofilm on the mudflat. Its spatial distribution is heterogeneous so it varies on a finer scale than that of airborne instrument spatial resolution, leading to a "mixed pixel" problem. Moreover, some microphytobenthic species form, at low tide, a biofilm deposited at the surface of the sediment substrate. The resulting signal is a highly non-linear combination of spectral endmembers due to microscale intimate mixtures. This prevents the use of classical linear unmixing models to retrieve biomass from reflectance spectra. A Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) is therefore used to remove the effects of surface roughness, shadowing and any other unknown processes that contribute to the overall shape (continuum) of the reflectance spectra. Then, relationships between microphytobenthos biomass and spectral shapes are derived from a spectral database compiled from laboratory reflectance spectra of microalgal monospecific cultures with different biomasses. Finally, microphytobenthos biomass and fractional cover are retrieved from the DAIS image by comparing the reflectance spectra of each pixel to a library of synthetic spectra corresponding to combinations of various biomasses and substrate percent cover. This new approach, when compared to more classically used ones such as indices, linear unmixing or spectral distance analysis, is proven to enable a much more reliable determination of biomass despite the large variety of substrates found in Bourgneuf Bay. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {The distribution of microphytobenthos on intertidal flats is heterogeneous and described as "patchy" over spatial scales of centimetres to kilometres. The spatial structure and the dynamics of microphytobenthic biomass during tidal emersion were investigated by creating high resolution fluorescence distribution maps of biomass (Fo) at the sediment surface (0.5 cm pixels, 20 cm×20 cm). The PSII maximum quantum efficiency was also calculated for correlation with biomass structure. Intertidal areas of the Biezelingsche Ham (Westerschelde) and Zandkreek (Oosterschelde), The Netherlands, were sampled during June 2000. The space-time variability of the discrete fields obtained was analysed by studying their spatial variogram and their time autocorrelation. Sites showed significant differences in absolute variation of microphytobenthic biomass and in the dynamics of the development of spatial structure throughout the emersion period. The variograms indicated little spatial correlations in the biomass fields above the 2 cm scale, while the time autocorrelation showed a strong persistence of biomass structure at time scales between 1 h and 5 h. The Biezelingse Ham biofilm was shown to be migratory in nature while the Zandkreek system was more stable. At the former site, biomass distribution became more homogenous with time, as upward migration of cells attenuated horizontal patchiness. At the Biezelingsche Ham site, maximum PSII quantum efficiencies varied inversely with biomass areas; reasons for this may include nutrient depletion and CO2 limitation within dense biofilms. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Tidal flats (non-vegetated area), along with coastal vegetation area, constitute the coastal wetlands (intertidal zone) between high and low water lines, and play an important role in wildlife, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles. However, accurate annual maps of coastal tidal flats over the last few decades are unavailable and their spatio-temporal changes in China are unknown. In this study, we analyzed all the available Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imagery (~44,528 images) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and a robust decision tree algorithm to generate annual frequency maps of open surface water body and vegetation to produce annual maps of coastal tidal flats in eastern China from 1986 to 2016 at 30-m spatial resolution. The resulting map of coastal tidal flats in 2016 was evaluated using very high-resolution images available in Google Earth. The total area of coastal tidal flats in China in 2016 was about 731,170 ha, mostly distributed in the provinces around Yellow River Delta and Pearl River Delta. The interannual dynamics of coastal tidal flats area in China over the last three decades can be divided into three periods: a stable period during 1986–1992, an increasing period during 1993–2001 and a decreasing period during 2002–2016. The resulting annual coastal tidal flats maps could be used to support sustainable coastal zone management policies that preserve coastal ecosystem services and biodiversity in China.},

Mud and microphytobenthos are resuspended simultaneously from the tidal flats in the estuary. The concentrations of these parameters in the main channels of the estuary are strongly affected by erosion due to wind-induced waves and by settlement during calm weather conditions. The resuspension of mud can be described as a linear function of the "effective windspeed," which is defined as the windspeed averaged over three high-water (6 h bracketing high water) periods preceding sampling. The resuspended fraction of microphytobenthos from the top 0.5-cm layer of sediment can also be described as a linear function of the effective windspeed. Our data indicate that for this estuary, the proper quantification of resuspension of mud and microphytobenthos requires consideration of relatively large areas.},

   abstract = {The effects of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) availability on photosynthesis were studied in two estuarine intertidal microphytobenthos (MPB) communities and in the model diatom species Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Kinetics of DIC acquisition, measured with a liquid-phase oxygen electrode, showed higher K 1/2(DIC) (0.31 mM) and Vm (7.78 nmol min-1 μg (Chl a)-1) for MPB suspensions than for P. tricornutum (K 1/2(DIC) = 0.23 mM; Vm = 4.64 nmol min-1 μg (Chl a)-1), suggesting the predominance of species with lower affinity for DIC and higher photosynthetic capacity in the MPB. The net photosynthetic rate of the MPB suspensions reached saturation at a DIC concentration of 1-1.5 mM. This range was lower than the concentrations found in the interstitial water of the top 5-mm sediment layer, suggesting no limitation of photosynthesis by DIC in the MPB communities. Accordingly, carbon isotope discrimination revealed a moderate activity of CO2-concentrating mechanisms in the MPB. However, addition of NaHCO3 to intact MPB biofilms caused a significant increase in the relative maximum photosynthetic electron transport rate (rETR max) measured by imaging pulse-amplitude modulated chlorophyll a fluorescence. These results suggest local depletion of DIC at the photic layer of the sediment (the first few hundred μm), where MPB cells accumulate during diurnal low tides. This work provides the first direct experimental evidence of DIC limitation of photosynthesis in highly productive intertidal MPB communities.},

The common internationally recognized topics relating to the tidal flat MPBs were found to be assemblages, dynamics, production, and food web etc. in chronological manner. Accordingly the review on the Korean MPBs studies was provided in the given topics, highlighting pros and cons of individual scientific efforts and data. Especially, the brief summary from the several representative works (selected based on citations) related with the corresponding topics were provided as for comparison, if applicable. The world studies of tidal flat MPBs over the past 100 years generally reflected the subjects being balanced followed by logical development of each topic. Although over 50 years of scientific gap between Korea and the European countries were evidenced historically, a rapid scientific advancement in recent 10 years would be noteworthy. A topic of floral assemblages was found to be steady issue in Korea, with documented MPBs of <400 species (ca. 10 new species) from the Korean tidal flats. As part of review, we reanalyzed our selected data from the previous and current MPBs works encompassing above 4 topics, where our key ecological findings were highlighted. Finally, future research direction was carefully discussed by comparative analysis between worldwide versus Korean studies in various aspects. Overall, the future MPBs studies in Korea would be promising to support unique biogeography in Asian tidal flats, yet with certain limitation in scientific recognition and/or methodological weakness.},

   abstract = {© 2014 Elsevier B.V.In response to the closure of shellfish production sites due to increasing occurrence of toxic algal blooms, land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) could be used by producers to store a proportion of their stock temporarily. An RAS prototype was tested in this study to store Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas over a range of temperatures. In such systems, the water temperature is a variable that could influence the bivalve excretion rate of ammonia, the concentration of which may become critical for the water quality. In this study, we first estimated the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN, N-NH4+ +N-NH3) excretion of the Pacific oyster and then investigated whether the bacterial population associated with the oysters could act as a natural biofilter by measuring the potential nitrification rate (PNR) of the shell. The TAN excretion rate varied significantly with temperature. The PNRs were significantly different depending on the shell surface considered with a PNR of 0.42±0.11 (SD)nmolNcm-2 h-1 for the internal part, 0.96±0.15 (SD)nmolNcm-2 h-1 for the external part of the shell. In addition, a 5-week experiment was conducted with a 180kg of oyster stock stored in a 1900L RAS to monitor TAN concentration and to establish a TAN budget at the level of an oyster population. The TAN concentration sharply declined in the RAS after 6 days and a stable concentration of 3.3±0.91 (SD)μmolNL-1 was reached till the end of the experiment. This measurement, as well as the estimation of a theoretical TAN budget based on the previous experiments, showed that the PNR and some other associated processes were sufficient to counteract the ammonia fluxes excreted by the oysters. This result underlines the significant role played by the nitrifying bacterial population colonizing the bivalve shell and suggests that such an oyster stock could be stored in a recirculating tank without the addition of a biofilter, which would represent a real economic advantage.},

   abstract = {© 2018 by the authors. This work is an extension of the MicroPhytoBenthos Optical Model (MPBOM) workflow. The model was based on the observation that the biofilm itself has a negligible inherent reflectance and can be described solely by the ratio between its apparent reflectance (R A ) and background reflectance (R B ), allowing a straightforward calculation of the absorption coefficient (α). This coefficient is directly related to pigment concentrations estimated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). To run the model, assess and extend the use of α, the background contribution is a critical step. This work shows that: (i) indices based on reflectance and absorption coefficient spectra derived from the optical model correctly identified the main microphytobenthos (MPB) groups covering a pixel; (ii) contrary to the RA index each new α index was insensitive to biomass variations; (iii) for each MPB group there was a significant linear relation between the biomass estimated by HPLC and α peak at 673 nm; (iv) indices based on α spectra were almost insensitive to mixing constraints at a subpixel level. Knowing the background reflectance contribution of MPB biofilms, α can therefore be used to map MPB algal composition and biomass at any scale from MPB synthetized in laboratory to intertidal mudflat airborne observations.},

   abstract = {Remote sensing of terrestrial vegetation uses a wide range of vegetation indices (VIs) to monitor plant characteristics, but these indices can be very sensitive to canopy background reflectance. This study investigated background influences on VIs applied to intertidal microphytobenthos, using a synthetic spectral library constituted by a spectral combination of three contrasting types of sediment (sand, fine sand, and mud) and reflectance spectra of benthic diatom monospecific cultures obtained in controlled conditions. The spectral database exhibited, for the same biomass range (3-182 mg chlorophyll am-2), marked differences in albedo and spectral contrast linked to sediment variability in water content, grain size, and organic matter content. Several VIs were evaluated, from ratios using visible and near infrared wavelengths, to hyperspectral indices (derivative analysis, continuum removal). Among the ratios, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) appeared less sensitive to background effects than VIs with soil corrections such as the Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI), the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Modified second Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2) or the Transformed Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI). The lower efficacy of soil-corrected VIs may be explained by the structural differences and optical behavior of soil vs. canopies compared to sediment vs. microphytobenthos biofilms. The background effects were minimized using Modified Gaussian Model indices at 632 nm and 675 nm, and the second derivative at 632 nm, while poor results were obtained with the red-edge inflection point (REIP) and the second derivative at 675 nm. The least sensitive index was the Phytobenthos Index which is very similar to the NDVI, but uses a red wavelength at 632 nm instead of 675 nm, to account for the absorption by chlorophyll c. The modified NDVI705, where the 705 nm wavelength replaces the red band, showed moderate background sensitivity. Moreover, the NDVI705 and the Phytobenthos Index have the additional relevant property of being less sensitive to the index saturation response with increasing biomass. Unfortunately, these VIs cannot be applied to broad-band multispectral satellite images, and require sensors with a hyperspectral resolution. Nevertheless, this study showed that the background influence was not a limitation to applying the ubiquitous NDVI to map intertidal microphytobenthos using multispectral satellite images. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The efficiency of vegetation indices (VIs) to estimate the above-ground biomass of the seagrass species Zostera noltii Hornem. from remote sensing was tested experimentally on different substrata, since terrestrial vegetation studies have shown that VIs can be adversely influenced by the spectral properties of soils and background surfaces. Leaves placed on medium sand, fine sand and autoclaved fine sand were incrementally removed, and the spectral reflectance was measured in the 400-900nm wavelength range. Several VIs were evaluated: ratios using visible and near infrared wavelengths, narrow-band indices, indices based on derivative analysis and continuum removal. Background spectral reflectance was clearly visible in the leaf reflectance spectra, showing marked brightness and spectral contrast variations for the same amount of vegetation. Paradoxically, indices used to minimize soil effects, such as the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and the Modified second Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI 2 ) showed a high sensitivity to background effects. Similar results were found for the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and for Pigment Specific Simple Ratios (PSSRs). In fact, background effects were most reduced for VIs integrating a blue band correction, namely the modified specific ratio (mSR (705) ), the modified Normalized Difference (mND (705) ), and two modified NDVIs proposed in this study. However, these indices showed a faster saturation for high seagrass biomass. The background effects were also substantially reduced using Modified Gaussian Model indices at 620 and 675nm. The blue band corrected VIs should now be tested for air-borne or satellite remote sensing applications, but some require sensors with a hyperspectral resolution. Nevertheless, this type of index can be applied to analyse broad band multispectral satellite images with a blue band. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {For the inhabitants of many of the world's major towns and cities, estuaries provide their first and nearest glimpse of a natural habitat. Despite the attempts of man to pollute or reclaim it, the estuarine ecosystem continues to provide a fascinating insight into a natural world where energy is transformed from sunlight into plant material, and then through the steps of a food chain is converted into a rich food supply for birds and fish. When the previous editions of this book appeared, biologists were beginning to realize that the estuarine ecosystem was an ideal habitat in which to observe the processes controlling biological productivity. In the intervening period, many more estuaries and their inhabitants have been studied intensively. It is now possible to answer many of the questions posed by the earlier editions, and to pursue further the explanation of high productivity in estuaries and of energy utilization at different trophic levels within estuarine food webs. A significant amount of new information has also been accumulated on the human use and abuse of these habitats, particularly the effects of pollution. Although the world's seas are vast and may appear capable of receiving unlimited quantities of human effluent, such waste is often first discharged into the confined waters of estuaries. In practice, marine pollution is often essentially estuarine pollution. To reflect the huge impact of humans on estuaries, and to consider how we may either modify, remove or enrich the estuarine ecosystem, three completely new chapters have been prepared in this edition. These consider anthropogenic change (including pollution) in estuaries, the diverse uses and abuses of the estuarine habitat by man, and the methods used to study human induced changes in estuaries. Finally, this text examines the ways in which estuarine management can monitor, control or prevent the pollution and destruction of this fragile ecosystem.},

In the Mediterranean Sea, Posidonia oceanica is the dominant endemic plant that affects physical, biogeochemical, and biological processes. The decline in the spatial distribution has been attributed to excessive anthropic pressures and other large-scale environmental changes. The monitoring of the spatial distribution requires an update and accurate seagrass meadows delineation, i.e. meadow edge marking with a replicable method. The present study aims to present an approach to support the coastal marine habitat mapping, under the scheme of the Natura 2000 network using very high resolution Earth observation data and to prove that satellite images can be used for the mapping of the deep limits of the seagrass meadows. Pixel-based classification and object-oriented image analysis have been implemented for the image classification. Pixel-based Support Vector Machines and object-based Nearest Neighbor classifiers provided the best results with an overall accuracy of more than 90%, while deep limits have been successfully identified and separated from the deep waters.},

Here, we focus on spatial resolution because some estuaries are smaller than the satellite nadir pixel width, and multiple pixels within an estuary are required for quality assurance. We used the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) Estuarine Data Mapper polygon set to determine the spatial resolution required to reliably image every estuary and sub-estuary in the continental US. Kilometre resolution ocean colour sensors resolve 25% of estuaries and 36% of sub-estuaries with a 3 × 3-pixel grid. The 300 m Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3 resolves 53% of continental US estuaries with a 3 × 3-pixel grid, and 85% of sub-estuaries. Currently orbiting 30 m resolution land imaging satellites are sufficient to resolve all US sub-estuaries and all estuaries in the Atlantic, 89% in the Gulf of Mexico, and 54% in the Pacific with a 3 × 3-pixel grid. However, 45% of Pacific estuaries cannot be resolved at 30 m resolution, because they have narrow riverine morphology. Our results indicate that a resolution of ≤15 m will be necessary to resolve these narrow riverine estuaries, which is only currently available with commercial satellites.},

Experiments comparing several popular classification algorithms yield up to 93.4% accuracy in detecting seagrass presence. In a feature strength analysis, the most important variables determining presence–absence are found to be Chlorophyll-α levels and Distance-to-Coast. For determining family, variables cannot be easily singled out; several different variables seem to be of importance, with Chlorophyll-α surpassing all others. In both problems, tree-based classification algorithms perform better than others, with Random Forest being the most effective. Hidden preferences reveal that Cymodocea and Posidonia favor the low, limited-range chlorophyll-α levels (<0.5 mg/m3), Halophila tolerates higher salinities (>39), while Ruppia prefers euryhaline conditions (37.5–39).},

   abstract = {Microphytobenthos plays a vital role in estuarine and coastal carbon cycling and food webs. Yet, the role of exogenous factors, and thus the effects of climate change, in regulating microphytobenthic biomass is poorly understood. We aimed to unravel the mechanisms structuring microphytobenthic biomass both within and across ecosystems. The spatiotemporal distribution of the biomass of intertidal benthic algae (dominated by diatoms) was estimated with an unprecedented spatial ex- tent from time-series of Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from a 6-year period of daily Aqua MODIS 250-m images of se- ven temperate, mostly turbid, estuarine and coastal ecosystems. These NDVI time-series were related to meteorological and environmental conditions. Intertidal benthic algal biomass varied seasonally in all ecosystems, in parallel with meteorology and water quality. Seasonal variation was more pro- nounced in mud than in sand. Interannual variation in biomass was small, but synchronized year- to-year biomass fluctuations occurred in a number of disjointed ecosystems. Air temperature ex- plained interannual fluctuations in biomass in a number of sites, but the synchrony was mainly driven by the wind/wave climate: high wind velocities reduced microphytobenthic biomass, ei- ther through increased resuspension or reduced emersion duration. Spatial variation in biomass was largely explained by emersion duration and mud content, both within and across ecosystems. The results imply that effects on microphytobenthic standing stock can be anticipated when the position in the tidal frame is altered, for example due to sea level rise. Increased storminess will also result in a large-scale decrease of biomass.},

Within the East Atlantic Flyway, along the coast of West-Africa, the intertidal mudflats of Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania, host over 2 million migratory waterbirds. Despite the protected status of the Banc d'Arguin, geographical remoteness and seemingly benign human exploitation, we show that large changes have taken place in the intertidal benthic macrofauna across an interval of 28 years. We compared the results of two comparable and spatially comprehensive large-scale benthic surveys in 1986 and 2014. Over this time, the benthos changed from a diverse community to one dominated by a few species of bivalve, with a loss of polychaete worms. The change was associated with a twofold increase in the seagrass cover. Our results suggest that the intertidal habitats of Banc d'Arguin have altered markedly over the last three decades and the estimated benthic secondary production has decreased by a factor of four. These shifts in community structure and production may have contributed to declines in some benthivorous migratory shorebirds.},

In the succession, bacteria were followed by diatoms and cyanobacteria. Encrusting algae appeared in the late stages of the experiment (day 80 in summer and day 60 in winter). Colonization by bacteria was much slower in summer and their density remained low throughout the experimental period. The first appearance of diatoms and cyanobacteria, however, was more rapid in the summer. Bacteria and diatoms on the low-shore surfaces also had a faster succession rate than on the high-shore surfaces, suggesting that desiccation/aerial temperature are the causal factors for such differences.},

   abstract = {Quantifying spatial variability in intertidal benthic productivity is necessary to guide management of estuaries and to understand estuarine ecological processes, including the amount of benthic organic carbon available for grazing, burial and transport to the pelagic zone. We developed a model to assess microphytobenthic (MPB) primary production using (1) remotely sensed information on MPB biomass and remotely sensed information on sediment mud content, (2) surface irradiance and ambient temperature (both from local meteorological observations), (3) directly-measured photosynthetic parameters and (4) a tidal model. MPB biomass was estimated using the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) and mud content was predicted using surface reflectance in the blue and near-infrared, both from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The photosynthetic capacity (maximum photosynthesis rate normalized to MPB chl-a) was estimated from ambient temperature, while photosynthetic efficiency and the light saturation parameter were derived from in situ fluorometry-based production measurements (PAM). The influence of tides (submergence by turbid water) on MPB production was accounted for in the model. The method was validated on several locations in two temperate tidal basins in the Netherlands (Oosterschelde and Westerschelde). Model based production rates (mg C m−2 h−1) matched well with an independent set of in situ (PAM) measurement based production rates (Oosterschelde: RMSE = 9.7, mean error = 1.5, χ = 0.57; Westerschelde: RMSE = 46.7, mean error = −17.6, χ = 0.9). The relationship between photosynthetic capacity and temperature shows considerable variation and may be improved by using sediment surface temperature instead of ambient temperature. A sensitivity analysis revealed that emersion duration and mud content determine most of the variability in MPB production. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to derive a satellite remote sensing-based overview of average hourly and daily MPB primary production rates at the macro scale. As the proposed model is generic, the model can be applied to other tidal systems to assess spatial variability in MPB primary production at the macro scale after calibration at the site of interest. Model calibration, results and possible applications for regular monitoring of MPB production are discussed below.},

   abstract = {Increasing human populations around the global coastline have caused extensive loss, degradation and fragmentation of coastal ecosystems, threatening the delivery of important ecosystem services1. As a result, alarming losses of mangrove, coral reef, seagrass, kelp forest and coastal marsh ecosystems have occurred1–6. However, owing to the difficulty of mapping intertidal areas globally, the distribution and status of tidal flats—one of the most extensive coastal ecosystems—remain unknown7. Here we present an analysis of over 700,000 satellite images that maps the global extent of and change in tidal flats over the course of 33 years (1984–2016). We find that tidal flats, defined as sand, rock or mud flats that undergo regular tidal inundation7, occupy at least 127,921 km2 (124,286–131,821 km2, 95% confidence interval). About 70% of the global extent of tidal flats is found in three continents (Asia (44% of total), North America (15.5% of total) and South America (11% of total)), with 49.2% being concentrated in just eight countries (Indonesia, China, Australia, the United States, Canada, India, Brazil and Myanmar). For regions with sufficient data to develop a consistent multi-decadal time series—which included East Asia, the Middle East and North America—we estimate that 16.02% (15.62–16.47%, 95% confidence interval) of tidal flats were lost between 1984 and 2016. Extensive degradation from coastal development1, reduced sediment delivery from major rivers8,9, sinking of riverine deltas8,10, increased coastal erosion and sea-level rise11 signal a continuing negative trajectory for tidal flat ecosystems around the world. Our high-spatial-resolution dataset delivers global maps of tidal flats, which substantially advances our understanding of the distribution, trajectory and status of these poorly known coastal ecosystems.},

   abstract = {The biodiversity and high productivity of coastal terrestrial and aquatic habitats are the foundation for important benefits to human societies around the world. These globally distributed habitats need frequent and broad systematic assessments, but field surveys only cover a small fraction of these areas. Satellite-based sensors can repeatedly record the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectra that contain the absorption, scattering, and fluorescence signatures of functional phytoplankton groups, colored dissolved matter, and particulate matter near the surface ocean, and of biologically structured habitats (floating and emergent vegetation, benthic habitats like coral, seagrass, and algae). These measures can be incorporated into Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), including the distribution, abundance, and traits of groups of species populations, and used to evaluate habitat fragmentation. However, current and planned satellites are not designed to observe the EBVs that change rapidly with extreme tides, salinity, temperatures, storms, pollution, or physical habitat destruction over scales relevant to human activity. Making these observations requires a new generation of satellite sensors able to sample with these combined characteristics: (1) spatial resolution on the order of 30 to 100-m pixels or smaller; (2) spectral resolution on the order of 5 nm in the visible and 10 nm in the short-wave infrared spectrum (or at least two or more bands at 1,030, 1,240, 1,630, 2,125, and/or 2,260 nm) for atmospheric correction and aquatic and vegetation assessments; (3) radiometric quality with signal to noise ratios (SNR) above 800 (relative to signal levels typical of the open ocean), 14-bit digitization, absolute radiometric calibration <2%, relative calibration of 0.2%, polarization sensitivity <1%, high radiometric stability and linearity, and operations designed to minimize sunglint; and (4) temporal resolution of hours to days. We refer to these combined specifications as H4 imaging. Enabling H4 imaging is vital for the conservation and management of global biodiversity and ecosystem services, including food provisioning and water security. An agile satellite in a 3-d repeat low-Earth orbit could sample 30-km swath images of several hundred coastal habitats daily. Nine H4 satellites would provide weekly coverage of global coastal zones. Such satellite constellations are now feasible and are used in various applications.},

   abstract = {Physiological and behavioral photoprotection are the two major mechanisms by which natural microphytobenthic assemblages protect themselves against high light. These mechanisms were investigated with high vertical resolution in intertidal epipelic (mud) and epipsammic (sand) benthic diatom communities. Photophobic cell migration was found in epipelic communities when exposed to high light, detected using pigment analysis of 200μm sediment depth layers and Low Temperature Scanning Electron Microscopy. In the mud, significant differences between migratory and non-migratory (Latrunculin A-treated) biofilms were observed in the photosynthetic activity measured using rapid light curves: after exposure to high light, non-migratory biofilms showed lower light use efficiency (lower μ) and lower maximum photosynthetic capacity (lower rETRmax). Increased de-epoxidation state (DPS) was observed in both epipelic and epipsammic diatom assemblages after exposure to high light: in the surface 400μm for mud and throughout the sediment profile up to 1mm for sand. The two diatom communities showed different photoregulatory strategies: the epipelic community of muddy sediments photoregulated using both physiological and behavioral photoprotection, while the epipsammic community of sandy sediments used exclusively physiological mechanisms. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The mean chlorophyll-a concentration of 113 mg Chl-a m-2 in the upper centimeter is of the same order of magnitude as in other estuarine areas. The average annual primary production of the microphytobenthos has been estimated at 136 g C m-2 y-1 The primary production of sediment inhabiting microalgae is at least 17% of the total primary production in the estuary. Considerable differences in annually averaged chlorophyll-a emerges between the stations.

   abstract = {Many methods for using diatoms for routine monitoring of water quality have been developed in Europe and, in some countries, these are being used to enforce environmental legislation. In order to facilitate their wider use, particularly with respect to European Union legislation, steps are being taken to harmonize methodology. In this paper, the principles and practice of sampling are described in relation to the main habitat types encountered in Europe. Although details of methods and sampling programmes have to be tailored to particular circumstances and the overall objectives of the monitoring, a number of generalizations can be made. Where available, rocks and other hard surfaces are the preferred substrates and methods for sampling these are described. If such substrata are not available, then introduced ('artificial') substrata have many applications. Various types of introduced substrata can be used successfully, so long as some basic precautions are described. Other types of substrata such as macrophytes and macroalgae may also be useful under certain circumstances, although there is less consensus in the literature on the most appropriate methods, and of the validity of comparisons between indices computed from epiphytic and epilithic communities. When designing surveys, it is recommended that as far as possible, extremes of non-water quality factors (e.g. shade, current speed, etc) are avoided, unless these are characteristic of the system under investigation. Detailed guidelines for sampling epilithon are described. Along with the recommendations for sampling other substrata, it is hoped that these provide a framework that can be adapted to most river types in Europe.},

   abstract = {A set of guidelines are presented for the definition of monitoring plans in coastal and transitional (estuarine and lagoonal) systems subject to the European Union Water Framework Directive - WFD (2000/60/EC). General principles of best practice in monitoring are outlined, including (a) the definition of three types of broad management objectives: water quality, conservation, and human use, to which the general public may easily relate. These will define the core and research indicators (WFD quality elements) to be used for monitoring; (b) priorities and optimisation in a (financially and logistically) resource-constrained environment; (c) quality assurance; and (d) assessment of monitoring success: this should focus on the outputs, i.e. the internal audit of the monitoring activity, and on the outcomes. The latter component assesses programme effectiveness, i.e. environmental success based on a set of clearly-defined targets, and informs management action. The second part of this work discusses the approach and actions to be carried out for implementing WFD surveillance, operational and investigative monitoring. Appropriate spatial and temporal scales for surveillance monitoring of different indicators are suggested, and operational monitoring is classified into either screening or verification procedures, with an emphasis on the relationship between drivers, pressure, state and response. WFD investigative monitoring is interpreted as applied research, and thus guidelines cannot be prescriptive, except insofar as to provide examples of currently acceptable approaches. Specific case studies are presented for both operational (coastal eutrophication control) and investigative monitoring (harmful algal blooms), in order to illustrate the practical application of these monitoring guidelines.

This study investigated the feeding behavior of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) relative to a natural microphytobenthic assemblage and the effect on the structure of this assemblage. Oysters were fed only benthic microalgae collected on the intertidal mud flats of Bourgneuf Bay (France) at a suspended particulate matter concentration above the threshold of pseudofeces production. All species in the assemblage were endemic diatoms characteristic of tidal mud flat environments. Four dominant ones, which were all solitary cells with spear-shaped frustules [Navicula ammophila (Grunow), Navicula rostellata (Kützing), Plagiotropis lepidoptera (Kuntze), and Staurophora amphioxys (Mann)] represented more than 95% of the 16 species involved. Analysis of feeding processes showed that the retention of the four main diatoms was not significantly different, but that two species, the smallest (N. ammophila [22 × 4 μm]) and the largest (P. lepidoptera [60 × 15 μm]), were preferentially ingested. The study of post-ingestive selection revealed that these two species were also preferentially digested, i.e., preferentially directed into the digestive diverticulum, when they passed through the gut of C. gigas. Cell size and shape did not appear to account for pre-ingestive and post-ingestive selection. The composition of the assemblage was significantly modified by oyster filtration, although the retention rates of the four main species were not significantly different. The composition of microalgae in psendofeces and feces as a result of pre-ingestive and post-ingestive selection differed from that in seawater.},

Biologists fail regularly in one aspect of reproducibility: taxonomy. In one recent study, Bortolus (2008) found that in a sample of 80 articles published in peer-reviewed ecology journals, 50 did not provide “any supporting information justifying or guaranteeing the correct identification of the organisms studied or manipulated” (p. 114). Usually, there is enough detail in almost all other parts of the methods section, but in order for their work to be truly repeatable, biologists should explain how they identified the species that are included in their study. This is not an onerous task, and it can usually be facilitated by the inclusion of one or more taxonomic references that were used to identify the species in question. Taxonomic identifications need not always be morphologically based but could instead rely on DNA-sequence data, preferably linked to sound taxonomic research (Dexter et al. 2010).},

Processes operating at smaller scales however, such as the impact of benthic macrofauna on MPB development, to date remain underinvestigated. In this study, we analysed the influence of wild <i>Crassostrea</i> gigas oyster reefs on MPB biofilm development using multispectral RS. A 30-year time series (1985&amp;ndash;2015) combining high resolution (30&amp;thinsp;m) Landsat and SPOT data was built in order to explore the relationship between <i>C. gigas</i> reefs and MPB spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Emphasis was placed on the analysis of a before after control impact (BACI) experiment designed to assess the effect of oyster killing on the surrounding MPB biofilms. Our RS data reveal that the presence of oyster reefs positively affects MPB biofilm development. Analysis of the historical time series first showed the presence of persistent, highly concentrated MPB patches around oyster reefs. This observation was then confirmed by the BACI experiment which showed that killing the oysters (while leaving the physical reef structure, i.e. oyster shells, intact) negatively affected both MPB biofilm biomass and spatial stability around the reef. As such, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of nutrient input as an explanation for the MPB growth promoting effect of oysters, whereby organic and inorganic matter released through oyster excretion and biodeposition stimulates MPB biomass accumulation. MPB also showed marked seasonal variations in biomass and patch shape, size and degree of aggregation around the oyster reefs. Seasonal variations in biomass, with higher NDVI during spring and fall, were consistent with those observed at broader scales in other European mudflats. Our study provides the first multi-sensor RS satellite evidence of the promoting and structuring effect of oyster reefs on MPB biofilms.},

   abstract = {Intertidal flats of the estuarine macro-intertidal Baie des Veys (France) were investigated to identify spatial features of sediment and microphytobenthos (MPB) in April 2003. Gradients occurred within the domain, and patches were identified close to vegetated areas or within the oyster-farming areas where calm physical conditions and biodeposition altered the sediment and MPB landscapes. Spatial patterns of chl a content were explained primarily by the influence of sediment features, while bed elevation and compaction brought only minor insights into MPB distribution regulation. The smaller size of MPB patches compared to silt patches revealed the interplay between physical structure defining the sediment landscape, the biotic patches that they contain, and that median grain-size is the most important parameter in explaining the spatial pattern of MPB. Small-scale temporal dynamics of sediment chl a content and grain-size distribution were surveyed in parallel during 2 periods of 14 d to detect tidal and seasonal variations. Our results showed a weak relationship between mud fraction and MPB biomass in March, and this relationship fully disappeared in July. Tidal exposure was the most important parameter in explaining the summer temporal dynamics of MPB. This study reveals the general importance of bed elevation and tidal exposure in muddy habitats and that silt content was a prime governing physical factor in winter. Biostabilisation processes seemed to behave only as secondary factors that could only amplify the initial silt accumulation in summer rather than primary factors explaining spatial or long-term trends of sediment changes. © Inter-Research 2012.},

The lack of data on the distribution of these significant aquatic plants complicates the quantification of their decreasing tendency.

Here, we exploit recent advances in high spatial resolution sensors and machine learning to study Mediterranean seagrasses. We process a multispectral RapidEye time series between 2011 and 2016 to detect interannual seagrass dynamics in 888 submerged hectares of the Thermaikos Gulf, NW Aegean Sea, Greece (eastern Mediterranean Sea). We assess the extent change of two Mediterranean seagrass species, the dominant Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, following atmospheric and analytical water column correction, as well as machine learning classification, using Random Forests, of the RapidEye time series. Prior corrections are necessary to untangle the initially weak signal of the submerged seagrass habitats from satellite imagery. The central results of this study show that P. oceanica seagrass area has declined by 4.1%, with a trend of −11.2 ha/yr, while C. nodosa seagrass area has increased by 17.7% with a trend of +18 ha/yr throughout the 5-year study period. Trends of change in spatial distribution of seagrasses in the Thermaikos Gulf site are in line with reported trends in the Mediterranean. Our presented methodology could be a time- and cost-effective method toward the quantitative ecological assessment of seagrass dynamics elsewhere in the future. From small meadows to whole coastlines, knowledge of aquatic plant dynamics could resolve decline or growth trends and accurately highlight key units for future restoration, management, and conservation.},

   abstract = {High spatial resolution satellite data (IKONOS) combined with in situ data was used to quantitatively estimate the spatial distribution of tidal flat characteristics for the Hwangdo tidal flat, Cheonsu Bay, Korea. The classification result was accurate in terms of a comparison with the in situ data, and the overall accuracy was 90.7%, which confirmed the validity of the classification. GIS analysis based on a probabilistic model was applied to a quantitative estimation of the relationship between each surface sediment facies and the spectral reflectance. Mud flat facies showed a high positive correlation (R2 = 0.91), and sand flat facies showed a high negative correlation (R2 = 1.00), which was a good reflection of the sedimentary characteristics of Hwangdo tidal flat. Relationships between each sediment facies and DEM also showed good agreement with the topographic characteristics in the study area. The study revealed that intertidal surface sediment classification using high resolution remote sensing imagery and in situ data successfully shows spectral and topographic characteristics of the study area. It was noted that spectral reflectance was affected by a combination of environmental factors, including grain size, topography, and remnant surface water. It is possible to determine the type of tidal flat through quantitative estimates of the spatial distribution of surface sediments according to their spectral reflectance. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10 m, 20 m and 60 m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30 m MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30 m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35 million km2 and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015. The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular MODIS Collection 6 MCD09CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 L1T and Sentinel-2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known. In particular, the resulting computed circular errors at 90% for the HLS product are 6.2 m and 18.8 m, for S10 and L30 products, respectively. The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds. Finally, several time series are presented to highlight the high potential of the HLS data set for crop monitoring.},

The overall objective of this work was to review the utilization of RF classifier in remote sensing. This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.},

The water quality monitoring that is critical to the management of this important water resource and ecosystem relies primarily on a system of fixed water-quality monitoring stations, but the limited spatial coverage often hinders understanding. Here, we show how the latest technology in visible/near-infrared imaging spectroscopy can facilitate water quality monitoring in this highly dynamic and heterogeneous system by enabling simultaneous depictions of several water quality indicators at very high spatial resolution. The airborne portable remote imaging spectrometer (PRISM) was used to derive high-spatial-resolution (2.6 × 2.6 m) distributions of turbidity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll-a concentrations in a wetland-influenced region of this estuary. A filter-passing methylmercury vs DOC relationship was also developed using in situ samples and enabled the high-spatial-resolution depiction of surface methylmercury concentrations in this area. The results illustrate how high-resolution imaging spectroscopy can inform management and policy development in important inland and estuarine water bodies by facilitating the detection of point- and nonpoint-source pollution, and by providing data to help assess the complex impacts of wetland restoration and climate change on water quality and ecosystem productivity.},

   abstract = {The changes in spatial distribution of intertidal Zostera noltii seagrass beds were studied with multispectral visible-infrared remote sensing in Bourgneuf Bay (France) over a 14-year period, between 1991 and 2005. Six SPOT satellite images acquired at low tide were calibrated using in situ spectroradiometric data and processed with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A steady and linear increase in meadow areas was observed between 1991 and 2005 with total surfaces colonized by Z. noltii increasing from 208 to 586 ha, respectively. A greater increase in the densest part of the meadow (NDVI > 0.4) was also observed: it represented only 15% of total meadow surfaces in 1991 vs. 35% in 2005. The seagrass expansion took place mainly towards the lower part of the intertidal zone, while in the upper intertidal zone the meadow appeared strictly limited by the +4 m (Lowest Astronomical Tide) bathymetric level. The influence of Z. noltii above-ground biomass variations on spectral reflectance was analyzed experimentally by spectrometry. Z. noltii displays a characteristic steep slope from 700 to 900 nm, increasing with increasing biomass. A quantitative relationship obtained experimentally between NDVI and the dry weight of leaves was used to produce a biomass distribution map. The distribution of Bourgneuf Bay intertidal seagrass beds is certainly constrained by the water turbidity and we suggest that tidal flat accretion could be a significant variable explaining the observed expansion downwards. With very limited spatial interactions, oyster aquaculture cannot be considered as a threat, while a recent increase in recreational hand fishing of Manila clams within the beds could become problematic. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Coastal zones are highly dynamical systems affected by a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcing factors that include sea level rise, extreme events, local oceanic and atmospheric processes, ground subsidence, etc. However, so far, they remain poorly monitored on a global scale. To better understand changes affecting world coastal zones and to provide crucial information to decision-makers involved in adaptation to and mitigation of environmental risks, coastal observations of various types need to be collected and analyzed. In this white paper, we first discuss the main forcing agents acting on coastal regions (e.g., sea level, winds, waves and currents, river runoff, sediment supply and transport, vertical land motions, land use) and the induced coastal response (e.g., shoreline position, estuaries morphology, land topography at the land-sea interface and coastal bathymetry). We identify a number of space-based observational needs that have to be addressed in the near future to understand coastal zone evolution. Among these, improved monitoring of coastal sea level by satellite altimetry techniques is recognized as high priority. Classical altimeter data in the coastal zone are adversely affected by land contamination with degraded range and geophysical corrections. However, recent progress in coastal altimetry data processing and multi-sensor data synergy, offers new perspective to measure sea level change very close to the coast. This issue is discussed in much detail in this paper, including the development of a global coastal sea-level and sea state climate record with mission consistent coastal processing and products dedicated to coastal regimes. Finally, we present a new promising technology based on the use of Signals of Opportunity (SoOp), i.e., communication satellite transmissions that are reutilized as illumination sources in a bistatic radar configuration, for measuring coastal sea level. Since SoOp technology requires only receiver technology to be placed in orbit, small satellite platforms could be used, enabling a constellation to achieve high spatio-temporal resolutions of sea level in coastal zones.},

   abstract = {The tidal flats of the Wadden Sea are a highly dynamic and largely natural ecosystem with high economic and ecological value but which are also at risk due to climate change, rising sea levels, algae blooms, invasive species and marine pollution. There is a need for the detection of emerging changes and the potential loss of the natural or semi-natural ecosystems accompanied by a decrease in water quality. Accessibility both from sea and land is very poor, which makes the monitoring and mapping of tidal flat environments from in situ measurements very difficult. In this study, a multi-sensor concept for the classification of intertidal areas in the Wadden Sea is developed. The basis for this method is a combined analysis involving RapidEye (RE) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data combined with ancillary vector data about the distribution of vegetation, shellfish beds and sediments for the accuracy assessment. The overall methodology is based on a hierarchical decision tree. First, the water coverage is separated from the tidal flats by using the normalized difference water index (NDWI). Second, the shellfish beds are estimated with the textural features of the TSX data and morphologic filters (MFs). Third, the classification of vegetation (salt marsh, sea grass/algae) is based on the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), object-based features and exclusionary criteria. The remaining area is then separated into different sediment types with an algorithm that uses a thresholding technique applied to radiometric values, the MSAVI and a majority filter. The results show that we are able to identify the location and shape of salt marsh and shellfish beds (a true positive rate of 0.63 and a precision of 0.55) by using multi-sensor remote sensing data. A detailed shellfish bed classification can only be done with radar sensors, like TSX. The extraction of the sea grass areas from the multi-sensor approach is difficult. Sea grass often grows very sparsely in the study area which, with respect to the spatial resolution of RE, leads to a mixture of the spectral signatures of sediment and sea grass. The classification of the sediment types in tidal flats is a challenge compared to vegetation and shellfish beds. An overall accuracy of 64.53%, 66.85%, 68.22% and 68.2% was achieved. The results emphasize that a sediment-type classification cannot be achieved with high accuracy using spectral properties alone due to their similarity, which is predominately caused by their water content.},

   abstract = {The effect of the filter-feeding bivalve Cerastoderma edule L. on microphytobenthos was investigated in three laboratory experiments. In the first experiment adult specimens of C. edule placed in flow-through aquaria containing sieved sediment were compared to aquaria without C. edule. The aquaria were incubated for 40 days, and sampled weekly for inorganic nutrient concentrations in the overlying water, sediment pigment concentrations and determination of benthic primary production. The presence of C. edule significantly increased the release of NH4+ and PO43- to the overlying water. The chlorophyll $α$ concentration in C. edule treatments increased, and was significantly higher than in controls. The benthic primary production in C. edule treatments increased, reaching a mean maximum of 27.9 mg C·M-2·h-1, while the controls stayed at the initial mean level of 14.7 mg C·m-2·h-1 throughout the experiment. When the possible effect of fertilizing with faecal pellets from C. edule was tested in a second experiment, no differences were observed in nutrient fluxes, chlorophyll $α$ concentration or primary production. In a third experiment, the effect of nutrients released by C. edule was investigated. Water from an aquarium containing a number of C. edule equivalent to the high natural density of cockles at the site of collection of the sediment was directed to four of the aquaria. The primary production was significantly higher in C. edule treatments than in controls. Thus the stimulating effect of C. edule on the microphytobenthos seems to be mediated by the release of nutrients, mainly NH4+, by the cockles themselves rather than through the deposition of faecal pellets. ©1991.},

Both fuels are shipped by sea, so the impact of spills on the marine benthos is a concern. We used microcosms to assess the relative impacts of simulated spills of these fuels on the microalgae of shallow subtidal sandy bottoms. Response variables included microalgal abundance, primary productivity, ratio of chlorophyll a to phaeophytin, and ratio of primary production to chlorophyll a. During our 88-day experiment, we found no significant differences between the fuels for any variable. We suggest that weathering before the spill reaches the shore removes the most toxic components, rendering the fuels essentially equal in their impact on benthic microalgae.},

Elemental geochemical data indicate an increase of metal concentrations from the beginning of the industrial period peaking in the 1990s, followed by an attenuation of metal contamination inputs to the estuary. Zinc isotope compositions suggest a binary mixing process between Zn derived from terrigenous material and multi-urban anthropogenic sources. Copper isotope systematics indicate a single natural dominant source represented by weathered silicate particles from soils and rocks. This work demonstrates the applicability of Zn isotopes to identify anthropogenic Zn sources in coastal systems, even under a low to moderate degree of contamination.

   abstract = {Artificial surfaces in coastal waters and offshore oceans, including boat hulls, docks, and offshore structures, are invariably colonized, or fouled, by a host of sessile species known collectively as fouling communities. Fouling has great economic impacts on shipping and other marine industries and plays an important role in the spread of marine invasive species across the globe. The main strategy to prevent fouling of artificial surfaces is application of antifouling coatings containing varying concentrations and mixtures of biocides. Presently, copper and zinc are popular antifouling biocides, and the latter is gaining in usage due to the known toxic characteristics of copper in the marine environment and consequent regulation and consumer opinion. Nanomaterials, including Cu and ZnO nanoparticles, have been explored as a way to efficiently deliver biocides from coating matrices. Here, we examine the efficacy and biocide release characteristics of several copper- and zinc-based antifouling coatings, including formulations containing traditional micron-sized Cu and ZnO particles and two containing copper and ZnO nanoparticles, respectively. Most of the antifouling coatings tested significantly reduced the abundance and biodiversity of the fouling community in the three study locations across California. Invasive species were suppressed by most coatings at similar levels to natives, suggesting that in general, antifouling coatings do not favor invasive species. We found that zinc-based antifouling coatings were similar and in some cases better performing than copper, despite the generally lower toxicity of zinc to aquatic organisms compared with copper. The performance of zinc-based coatings, moreover, was not directly related to the amount of zinc released into the water or their zinc content. Nano-based coatings did not offer any clear advantages over non-nano coatings, either in the degree of Zn leaching or fouling suppression. Coating matrix properties clearly are an important factor affecting the efficacy and biocide leaching rate of antifouling coatings.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to contribute to a better understanding of turbid coastalecosystems, focusing on spatio-temporal changes at the mesoscale in microphytobenthos structuresin a macrotidal bay (Bourgneuf, France). This was based on pigment analysis by high-pressure liquidchromatography (HPLC), reinforced by microscopy observations, in relation to sediment characteristics.Microphytobenthos assemblages of this mudflat were 97% dominated by diatoms, confirmed byHPLC analysis, which showed biomarker pigments of this group: chlorophyll c, fucoxanthin, diadinoxanthinand diatoxanthin. The main assemblage is constituted of epipsammic species, likePlagiogrammopsis, Achnanthes and Cocconeis, characterising mixed sediments. However, this couldbe replaced by epipelic species, like Plagiotropis, Pleurosigma and Staurophora, during summer dueto station silting. Microphytobenthic photosynthetic active biomass in the first 2 mm varied spatiallyand temporally from 12.2 to 186.9 mg chl a m–2. The predominance of a biomass spatial variabilityreflected spatial changes in sediment grain size and water content. Biomass in the first 2 mm representedfrom 28 to 68% of the total amount in the first 10 mm. This indicated an accumulation of biomassin illuminated layers and a biomass decrease with depth associated with increasing values ofthe ratio of phaeopigments a and fucoxanthin to chlorophyll a (phaeo a/chl a and fuco/chl a). Bothcould exceed 1.00 in deeper layers. Temporal changes in microphytobenthos structure at themesoscale were mainly linked to hydrodynamism. This is stronger in winter and responsible forallochthonous pigment input (lutein and phaeophytin b) and sediment mixing, as grazing activity bymacro- and meiofauna, forming chlorophyll a breakdown products, is responsible for an increase infuco/chl a and phaeo a/chl a values during spring/summer.},

   abstract = {The EU Water Framework Directive1 (WFD) is an ambitious legislation framework to achieve good ecological and chemical status for all surface waters and good quantitative and chemical status for groundwater by 2027. A total of 111,062 surface waterbodies are presently reported on under the Directive, 46% of which are actively monitored for ecological status. Of these waterbodies 80% are rivers, 16% are lakes, and 4% are transitional and coastal waters. In the last assessment, 4% (4,442) of waterbodies still had unknown ecological status, while in 23% monitoring did not include in situ water sampling to support ecological status assessment2. For individual (mainly biological) assessment criteria the proportion of waterbodies without observation data is much larger; the full scope of monitoring under the WFD is therefore still far from being realised. At the same time, 60% of surface waters did not achieve ‘good’ status in the second river basin management plan and waterbodies in Europe are considered to be at high risk of having poor water quality based on combined microbial, physical and physicochemical indicators3. Water quality metrics derived from satellite observation can complement conventional water sampling, particularly to achieve much improved spatial and temporal coverage of medium (several square kilometres) and larger waterbodies. Thus, it has the potential to enhance confidence in WFD ecological status classification, firstly by quantifying elements of environmental status that are currently not or under-reported by Member States, such as the frequency, onset, duration and extent of phytoplankton blooms. Second, confidence in ecological status assessment would improve with increased representativeness of the natural diversity of waterbodies that are monitored, their inter-annual variability and water quality trends within larger waterbodies. Moreover, using standardised approaches, it would allow better comparison and standardization of water quality assessment across Member States, facilitating the management of transboundary waters in particular. Finally, by increasing spatial and temporal coverage, satellite observation is expected to enhance the effectiveness of the Programme of Measures (PoM) through early detection of deterioration, improving knowledge of the potential extent of an impact, improving monitoring of the effectiveness of PoMs and providing information to support more strategic in situ sampling. The European Union and European Space Agency currently boast the most advanced suite of satellite-based instruments designed to observe optical water quality. The Copernicus framework of sensors and services has had significant investment in recent years. Therefore, the vast majority of the cost associated with satellite-based monitoring of surface waters has already been invested.},

   abstract = {Estuaries and coastal areas are highly important natural habitats, amongst the mostproductive marine ecosystems on earth. They provide vital ecosystem services tomankind and are particularly valuable as habitats and feeding grounds for a variety oforganisms, such as birds, shellfish, demersal fish and invertebrates, which often supportthe local economy. However, these ecosystems are under strong anthropogenic pressurecaused by intensive human exploitation (e.g. industry, fishery, tourism, domestic sewers).One of the major primary producing groups of these areas are microscopic algae thatinhabit intertidal sediments (microphytobenthos, MPB), even though their photosyntheticactivity is restricted to the narrow illuminated layer of surface sediment, where they formdense aggregates called biofilms. Microphytobenthic biomass often exceeds that of thephytoplankton in the overlying tidal waters. MPB provides an important energy sourcefor the estuarine food web, supplying up to 45% of the organic resources of an estuary,and has a central role in moderating carbon flow in coastal sediments. Some relationshipshave also been established between the surface concentration of MPB and critical erosionshear-stresses, therefore providing important information about sediment erodability anddynamics in coastal areas. These vital ecosystem functions emphasize the need to detect and monitormicrophytobenthic biofilms accurately at the ecosystem scale. However, samplingintertidal flats is a complex, and frequently difficult, task. Intertidal sediments are oftendominated by small sediment particles ( <  63 μm) forming large mudflats that are veryhard to navigate or walk. It is therefore almost impossible to monitor MPB spatialdynamics using regular field sampling. This has led to a growing interest in the use ofremote sensing techniques to detect microphytobenthic assemblages. MPB can exhibitconsiderable taxonomic and pigment variability, which is lost when chlorophyll a is usedas a single descriptor of the community. These different microalgae groups displaydifferent pigment compositions with specific absorption features, which can be capturedby hyperspectral sensors.In this chapter, we will first introduce the principles of imaging spectrometry (alsocalled hyperspectral remote sensing). Because of its high spectral resolution (from 1 to 35nm) and continuous sampling of the solar spectrum (more than 100 images acquiredcontiguously and simultaneously), imaging spectrometry can identify pigments based ontheir specific absorption features. We then present some algorithms developed to mapMPB in coastal areas. Analyzing the strength and shape of the specific absorptionfeatures leads to quantitative estimations of pigment concentration that would beimpossible to obtain from standard multispectral images. Finally, imaging spectrometryalso provides access to information at the subpixel level, dealing with the problem ofintimate (non-linear) versus areal (linear) mixtures. ©2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

   abstract = {© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.The invasion of the wild oyster Crassostrea gigas along the western European Atlantic coast has generated changes in the structure and functioning of intertidal ecosystems. Considered as an invasive species and a trophic competitor of the cultivated conspecific oyster, it is now seen as a resource by oyster farmers following recurrent mass summer mortalities of oyster spat since 2008. Spatial distribution maps of wild oyster reefs are required by local authorities to help define management strategies. In this work, visible-near infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing was investigated to map two contrasted intertidal reef structures: clusters of vertical oysters building three-dimensional dense reefs in muddy areas and oysters growing horizontally creating large flat reefs in rocky areas. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions with an ASD spectroradiometer, was used to run Spectral Angle Mapper classifications on airborne data obtained with an HySpex sensor (160 spectral bands) and SPOT satellite HRG multispectral data (3 spectral bands). With HySpex spectral/spatial resolution, horizontal oysters in the rocky area were correctly classified but the detection was less efficient for vertical oysters in muddy areas. Poor results were obtained with the multispectral image and from spatially or spectrally degraded HySpex data, it was clear that the spectral resolution was more important than the spatial resolution. In fact, there was a systematic mud deposition on shells of vertical oyster reefs explaining the misclassification of 30% of pixels recognized as mud or microphytobenthos. Spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs were coupled with in situ biomass measurements to illustrate the interest of a remote sensing product to provide stock estimations of wild oyster reefs to be exploited by oyster producers. This work highlights the interest of developing remote sensing techniques for aquaculture applications in coastal areas.},

   abstract = {Among microphytobenthic species (unicellular algae and cyanobacteria), benthic diatoms are often the most common photosynthetic organisms colonizing shallow marine environment such as an intertidal flat. As such areas, particularly mudflats of limited access for point sampling, remote sensing techniques have the potential to map diatom biomass. This study used two monospecific cultures of the benthic diatoms Navicula ramosissima and Entomoneis paludosa, isolated from mudflats in Bourgneuf Bay (France), to obtain a biomass range. Exponential and senescent stages of microalgal growth were also tested. The objective was to relate the spectral reflectance obtained by spectroradiometry to the composition and amount of principal and accessory pigments measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Analysis of pigments vs. chlorophyll a ratios revealed differences between these two diatom species, mainly due to fucoxanthin and diadinoxanthin. These interspecific variations among the class of Bacillariophyceae were also detected by spectroradiometry. No differences were observed between the two growth stages, and cell senescence had no effects on spectral properties. The chlorophyll pigments used to establish a relationship between diatom biomass and spectral reflectance gave the most interesting results for an absorption band at 632 nm corresponding to chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c. This band, contrary to that at 673 nm related to chlorophyll a only and traditionally used for biomass estimations in green plants, provided the largest range of variations and was not saturated at a high biomass concentration. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

This is only few percent of the supply from adjacent marine areas, as the yearly transport through the study area is 218000 tons of N and 18250 tons of P. Yearly net deposition makes up 1340 tons of N (on average 2.5 g m-2 yr-1) and 477 ton of P (on average 0.9 g m-2 yr-1). Shallow-water parts of the study area have no net deposition because of frequent (> 35% of the year) resuspension. Resuspension frequency in deep water is <1% of the year. Resuspension rates, as averages for the study area, are 10-17 times higher than net deposition rates. Because of resuspension, shallow-water sediments are coarse lag deposits with small amounts of organic matter (1.1%) and nutrients (0.04% N and 0.02% P). Deep-water sediments, in contrast, are fine grained with high levels of organic matter (11.7%) and nutrients (0.43% N and 0.15% P). Laboratory studies showed that resuspension changes the diffusive sediment water fluxes of nutrients, oxygen consumption, and penetration into the sediment. Fluxes of dissolved reactive phosphate from sediment to water after resuspension were negative in organic-rich sediments (13.2% organic matter) with low porosity (56) and close to zero in coarse sediments with a low organic matter content (2.3%) and high porosity (73). Fluxes of inorganic N after resuspension were reduced to 70% and 0-20% in relation to the rates before resuspension, respectively.},

Three stations (7, 15, and 22 m deep) were investigated at ca 2 mo intervals in the Northern Adriatic Sea over a 19 mo period. High chl a contents of the sediments were found in spring (March, April) and fall (September, October) while sediment bacterial numbers fluctuated in an inconsistent pattern. Porewater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exhibited strong seasonal variation with highest concentrations in September (20 mg Cl super(-1)); subsequently porewater DOC declined to ca 5 mg Cl super(-1) (March-April). In general, porewater DOC increased slightly with depth down to the 10-15 cm horizon. Benthic respiration was found to be temperature dependent; below 10 degree C about 6 mg C m super(-2) h super(-1) were respired while at 20 degree C the rate was 17 mg C m super(-2) h super(-1). Microphytobenthos gross primary production (GPP) was detected even at the deepest station and remained fairly constant from March to September (ca 100 mg C m super(-2) d super(-1)).},

   abstract = {Estuaries are important ecosystems from environmental and economical point of views and are the place of numerous transformations of organic matter (OM) during the transfer from land to the ocean. The dynamics of OM in estuarine systems is complex and was only rarely investigated at the structural or molecular level, even though OM transformation in the estuarine aquatic and sediment compartments involves processes taking place at this level. The aim of this study was to constrain the sources and fate of the OM in the Seine Estuary, one of the largest estuaries in France. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the OM along the estuary was investigated by comparing the bulk (elemental and isotopic composition) and structural (solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance) features of the different pools of OM – dissolved OM (DOM), particulate OM (POM) and sediment OM collected during five sampling campaigns. Reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis (RO/ED) was used to concentrate and isolate DOM, yielding an average organic carbon recovery of 59% (± 15%). RO/ED had a limited effect on DOM properties, DOM showing >75% of similarity with initial estuarine samples based on 3D fluorescence measurements. Bulk and structural analyses of DOM, POM and sedimentary OM showed that OM is mainly of aquatic origin in the Seine Estuary, regardless the OM pool. Nevertheless, significant differences in chemical composition between the three OM pools were observed: higher C/N ratios, carbohydrate, lipid and protein content as well as lower char and lignin contents in DOM than in the other two compartments. Spatial variations of OM properties, for POM and to a lesser extent DOM, were observed along the Seine Estuary based on $δ$13C and $Δ$14C analyses and 13C NMR-derived protein and lipid contents, showing the transition from a riverine to a marine-dominated system. In the mixing zone of the estuary, the $Δ$14C composition of the sediment OM was related to the tidal strength, with strong tides leading to the resuspension of recent sediment OM and weak tides allowing the deposition of recent aquatic OM. Altogether, the combination of bulk and structural techniques showed that the Seine Estuary OM quality is mainly related to the compartment (DOM/POM/sediment) and to a lesser extent to the sampling zone (upstream/maximum turbidity zone/downstream). The approach proposed for the characterization of the Seine Estuary OM could be applied to other estuaries, allowing a better understanding of the complex OM dynamics in such ecosystems.},

   abstract = {The release of harmful metals from antifouling paints to water bodies is a well-known problem. In this study, we measured both the amount of biofouling growth on leisure boats during one season as well as the concentration of metals accumulated by the biofouling matrix. Furthermore, the efficiency of antifouling paints and mechanical boat cleaning as well as the effect of hull colour on biofouling were evaluated. Unlike paint residues, biofouling waste has never been regarded as a source of metal contamination and has previously been neglected in the scientific literature. Our results revealed that the biofouling waste contained very high concentrations of metals, up to 28,000 mg copper/kg dw and 171,000 mg zinc/kg dw, which exceeds the guidance values for least sensitive land use in Sweden by factors of 140 and 340, respectively. This observation is important because the contaminated biofouling waste is commonly disposed of in boatyard soils at the end of each season, thus increasing the levels of metal pollution. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the amount of biofouling if the boats were coated with copper or zinc containing paints or no paint at all, indicating that biocide paints might not be necessary in low-salinity areas such as the Stockholm archipelago. For boats that were not painted at all during the season, those washed on boat washers (mechanically) had on average half of the amount of biofouling compared to boats that were not cleaned mechanically. The results of the study indicate the importance of proper management of biofouling waste as well as the use of more environmentally friendly removal methods for biofouling such as boat washers.},

   abstract = {In New Caledonia, the benthic communities living in the coral reef lagoon around Noumea city are subjected to regular shifts from oligotrophic conditions typical of lagoon waters to nutrient enrichment due to waste water inputs. The influence of ammonium pulses on microphytobenthos production was experimentally tested under varying light intensities in the vicinity of Noumea. Benthic oxygen, ammonium and silicon fluxes at the sediment-water interface were measured in situ using benthic enclosures. Three ammonium concentrations were tested. Gross primary production was doubled with a 13.8 $μ$mol l-1 ammonium concentration increase. Fitted PI curves showed that maximum production (Fmax) was linearly related to ammonium concentration, but not the optimal irradiance (Ik). Silicon fluxes were characterized by dissolution in the absence of light, a process that declined with increasing illumination. These results were attributed to microphytobenthos activity, mainly diatoms that are nutrient-limited and strongly reactive to ammonium inputs. Production may result from a multiplication of cells, but migration up to the water sediment interface may also be involved. Oxygen consumption was also significantly influenced by ammonium concentration as a positive linear relationship with added ammonium concentration was established. Even during short-term experiments, ammonium enrichment stimulated photoautotrophic production, increasing the energy available to heterotrophs. Furthermore, microbenthic activities as well as nitrate production were increased by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria able to grow chemolithotrophically at the expense of oxygen. Therefore, in the study area, pulses of urban waste waters resulted in a decrease of plant-related autotrophy in benthic communities. ©2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The spatio-temporal variation of microphytobenthos (MPB) at the scale of a large estuary (Tagus estuary, Portugal) was studied using a combination of field and satellite remote sensing data during 2003. This is the first attempt to use remote sensing to study MPB in an ecosystem with a Mediterranean-like climate. Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) images were used to map benthic microalgae through the application of a Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI). A significant relationship between in-situ benthic chlorophyll a measurements and SPOT NDVI values was used to derive a map for biomass spatial distribution.At the scale of the whole intertidal area, NDVI time-series from 2003 revealed that MPB showed clear temporal variations, with lower values observed in summer compared to winter. This seasonal trend was found both in the SPOT and MERIS images and may be the result of extreme high temperatures that inhibit MPB growth. The main MPB biofilms were spatially stable through time at a large scale. Maximum NDVI values during the winter were found in the high shore with decreasing NDVI values towards the low shore. MPB light limitation at the lowest bathymetries is likely to occur in winter due to the high turbidity of Tagus estuary.The biomass spatial distribution map, obtained for January 2003, indicated low values ranging from 0 to 20mgChl am-2 for the lower shores, while in the upper shore biomass varied between 60 and 80mg Chlam-2. This study suggests striking differences in MPB seasonal patterns between the northern and southern European estuaries and stresses the need for ecophysiological approaches to investigate the role of thermo- and photo-inhibition as structuring factors for MPB biomass distribution. ©2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Temporal trends in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were reconstructed from sediment cores collected in the Martot and Les Damps ponds, downstream of the Eure River watershed. PAHs exhibited a positive correlation with fine fractions, but mainly with the refractory organic carbon measured in the sediments, which suggests PAH inputs from materials largely composed of refractory carbon (e.g. soot). Since around the 1940s, PAH concentrations ranged between 2.93–38.20 and 2.27–28.20 mg kg−1 in sediment cores from the Martot and Les Damps ponds, respectively. Based on the temporal distribution of isomers and diagnostic ratios, the PAHs in the sediments were found to be predominantly of pyrogenic origin, particularly in the 1940s–1960s, when PAH levels were particularly high. PCBs also showed an affinity with the fine fraction and with refractory organic carbon, albeit less so than PAHs. Since around the 1940s, PCB concentrations ranged between 0.02–1.57 in Martot Pond and 0.09–1.60 mg kg−1 in Les Damps Pond. The recorded PCB temporal trends were mainly associated with the production, consumption, and banning of these chemicals in France. According to the temporal distribution of PCB congeners, high levels in the 1950s–1970s were linked to “technical mixture” discharges into waterways, which were mainly composed of “low chlorinated congeners”, whereas PCB levels after the 1970s were of atmospheric origin.},

The influence of benthic macrofaunal organisms on microphytobenthic biomass, spatial distribution and photosynthetic capacities is not only resulting from their feeding intensity but also indirectly from their bioturbation activity, which regulates nutrient fluxes and sediment mixing. This study compares the impact of two species (Hediste diversicolor and Scrobicularia plana) that dominate macrofaunal communities in estuarine intertidal mudflats on microphytobenthic biomass and photosynthetic activity. Imaging-PAM fluorescence was used to non-invasively map the development of microphytobenthic biomass and to assess its spatial extent. Our results showed that, due to intense deposit feeding, Scrobicularia plana quickly limited microphytobenthos growth and photosynthetic activity, even at low density (<250 ind m−2). In contrast, the negative impact of Hediste diversicolor on microphytobenthos development due to direct consumption was very low. Thereby, the stimulation of nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface resulting from bioirrigation seems to enhance microphytobenthos growth and photosynthesis.},

   abstract = {The spatial variation in abundance and composition of subtidal meiobenthos communities was studied in two Portuguese estuaries under distinct degrees of anthropogenic pressure. Samples were collected from 20 sampling stations along both estuarine gradients from freshwater (<0.5) to euhaline areas (>30). Of these stations 11 were located in the Mondego estuary, a system exposed to high anthropogenic stress, and 9 in the Mira estuary, a naturally stressed system located inside the Natural Park Costa Vicentina (south-western coast of Portugal). Total meiobenthos density was higher in the Mira estuary and in both estuaries the community was dominated by nematodes. Among the twelve taxa identified in the Mira estuary, Harpacticoid copepods and Polychaeta were the second and the third most abundant groups respectively. In the Mondego estuary, Polychaeta was the second while Harpacticoid copepods was the third most abundant group in the thirteen total taxa recorded. Estuarine gradients of salinity, particles size and water nutrients were clearly detected in both estuaries and there was significant spatial heterogeneity in abundance and composition of the subtidal meiobenthos communities along these environmental gradients. Accordingly, three distinct sections were identified in both estuaries: (i) freshwater sections, where total density, and density of nematodes and Harpacticoid copepods reached minimum values; (ii) oligohaline and mesohaline sections, where the total density was low and diversity was poor; and (iii) polyhaline and euhaline sections, where both total density and diversity reached the highest values. The similar spatial distribution of meiobenthos assemblages in both estuaries suggests that natural stressors may be the major factors controlling the physicochemical conditions that determine meiobenthos community patterns. The mesoscale variability of subtidal meiobenthos density and composition within estuaries (in the order of kilometres) seems to be more important than the variability between estuaries (at the scale of hundreds of kilometres), a common feature in intertidal systems. From the management point of view, these results, based on higher taxa resolution, represent an obvious constraint to the applicability of ecological quality evaluation tools.

   abstract = {This study was undertaken to assess the response of meiofauna and nematode (multispecies) associations in terms of density, diversity, and composition to different environmental contaminants and also to evaluate the use of meiofauna and nematodes as indicators in pollution monitoring. Sediment was collected from the mouth of the Swartkops River estuary and defaunated by successive freezing and thwarting. The sediment was then subdivided into flasks and treated with different contaminants (organic carbon, Zn, Cu, Pb, Fe) at different concentrations, before meiofauna-rich sediment was added to each of them. The setup was allowed to mature for 32 days. Various biological indices were used to assess the biological status of the nematode communities in the laboratory experiment. Nematode identification was done to the genus level. The results indicate that higher concentrations of heavy metals and organic carbon had an impact on the nematode density, diversity, and community structure. Nematode genera such as Axonolaimus, Theristus, and Paramonohystera were found to be tolerant to metal pollution. This study also observed that nematode communities react differently to metal and organic pollution. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The response of an ecological community to a disturbance event, and its capacity to recover, are of major interest to ecologists, especially at a time of increasing frequencies and intensities of environmental change brought about by humans. Meiofauna, a group of small-sized organisms, are an abundant and ubiquitous component of seafloor communities that respond rapidly to environmental change. We summarise the available research on the response of metazoan meiofauna to the most widespread anthropogenic disturbances in the marine environment, including bottom fishing, the introduction of invasive species and anthropogenic climate change. We show that disturbance effects on habitats interact critically with effects on resident meiofauna species. Their responses are consistent with competitive replacement, where disparate disturbance effects on competing species drive shifts in dominance and intra- and interspecific interactions. The widespread replacement of habitat-specific ecological specialists by broadly-adapted ecological generalists and opportunists results in biotic and functional homogenisation of once disparate biotas. Anthropogenic disturbances may facilitate novel interactions among meiofauna species, and between meiofauna and other benthic organisms, but the number and breadth of these interactions is likely to be limited. Knowledge about the dependence of meiofauna species on their environment and on other benthic species has been growing. Future studies will be most meaningful if this knowledge is expanded alongside understanding the potential of locally adapted species to respond to shifts in environmental conditions.},

   abstract = {L'orientation générale La procédure d'élaboration et d'adoption de la directive a mis en évidence les stratégies respectives des Etats membres, via le Conseil, et du Parlement. In fine, le résultat de la conciliation fait apparaître les priorités de chacun : le Conseil s'est prioritairement attaché à maîtriser les contraintes devant être imposées aux Etats membres et les coûts induits. Son attachement à maintenir le caractère non obligatoire de la récupération des coûts par exemple, manifeste cette attention à un enjeu dépassant fortement la politique de l'eau et rejaillissant sur les équilibres économiques et sociaux nationaux ; le Parlement s'est plutôt concentré sur les aspects écologiques et sur le caractère obligatoire des objectifs fixés dans ce domaine. Il est par exemple demeuré inflexible sur les dispositions concernant les substances dangereuses, et sur l'inscription dans le texte de la directive du caractère essentiel de la dimension environnementale. Finalement, si la directive-cadre innove par une approche transversale de l'eau et par l'intégration d'une importante dimension économique, la dimension écologique, plus " classique ", apparaît donc très clairement. Cette double dimension se retrouve ainsi dès le premier considérant qui énonce que " L'eau n'est pas un bien marchand comme les autres mais un patrimoine qu'il faut protéger, défendre et traiter comme tel. " Plusieurs autres considérants témoignent également de la prégnance de la dimension écologique. Ainsi, le deuxième considérant rappelle le point de référence initial du texte, qui est le séminaire ministériel de Francfort (1988) soulignant la nécessité d'une législation communautaire sur la qualité écologique. La Commission avait d'ailleurs présenté en 1992 une première proposition sur ce thème, qui a ensuite été écartée en raison d'une approche trop fortement écologique ne correspondant plus aux attentes des acteurs. De même, le considérant 27 précise que " l'objectif ultime consiste à assurer l'élimination de substances dangereuses prioritaires et à contribuer à obtenir, dans l'environnement marin, des concentrations qui soient proches des niveaux de fond pour les substances présentes naturellement ". Cette place accordée aux enjeux écologiques tient aussi au postulat partagé par la Commission, le Parlement et le Conseil : la protection de l'environnement est l'objectif principal en ce qu'il permet de répondre aux autres objectifs que sont l'approvisionnement en eau potable des …},

Biotic variables of biomass, abundance and species composition of microphytobenthos were evaluated together with environmental variables, including irradiance, sediment temperature, grains size, pore water salinity, pH, nutrients, organic matter, water content and heavy metal concentrations in the sediment. The relationships between biotic and environmental parameters showed that: (1) the microphytobenthos biomass and community structures showed significant differences among different sediment types; (2) variation in the microphytobenthos communities were significantly correlated with environmental variables, especially with the heavy metals, grain size, irradiance, pore water salinity, organic matter and concentration of PO43+ and Si(OH)4; (3) the species number and richness were both significantly correlated with organic matter, and (4) the species Entomoneis corrugate, Navicula aitchelbee and Gyrosigma cf.limosum were positively correlated to heavy metals, and so were N. phylleptosoma, Surirella brebissonii to Si(OH)4 and NH4+ concentrations, and G. acuminatum and S. brebissonii to PO43+ and NH4+. It is suggested that the spatial variation in biodiversity of microphytobenthos may reflect environmental quality status in coastal intertidal ecosystems.},

Meiofauna patches ranged from <4-154 cm2, large diatom (>4 $μ$m) patches from <4-113 cm2 and smaller cell (<40 $μ$m) patches from <4-79 cm2. High variability in patch size was observed between taxa or genera, between years, and a 2nd aggregation level (small patches within large clumps) was shown by harpacticoid copepods. There were spatial associations among meiofauna and microphytobenthos assemblages but not with nanophytobenthos (cells <40 $μ$m), but no very close overlap was detected and microphytobenthos was thought to only partially influence meiofauna dispersion. Selectivity of trophic interactions seems to exist and meiofauna spatial patterns may be generated by feeding preferences. -from Author},

   abstract = {This review analyses the ostracod responses to pollution-induced environmental changes by anthropogenic impacts. Different biological features such as the variability of the local assemblages, population density, species diversity, age population structure and polymorphism, coupled with the favourable results of recently developed bioassays, suggest that these microorganisms may be included between the most promising sentinel groups in both brackish and marine areas. In meiofaunal studies, these microcrustaceans show high sensitivity to heavy-metal pollution, oil discharges and anoxic conditions. In specific investigations based on surveys of recent populations or stratigraphic box-core analysis, both ostracod densities and species diversities decrease remarkably near sources of pollution after a period of pollutant discharge, with a lesser impact in distant or protected areas. Strong heavy metal pollution or frequent oil spills may cause the disappearance of these organisms or a strong reduction in the number of individuals in a relatively short time period, whereas total or partially untreated urban wastes or agricultural discharges causing eutrophication effects lead to the dominance of distinctive species that are adapted to hypoxic conditions. The environmental improvement derived from the recent implementation of legal regulations in some countries has also been documented in the changes in ostracod assemblages back to pre-disturbed conditions. In addition to population and community changes, morphological and geochemical changes can also be detected in the ostracod carapace, which serves as a tracer of the water quality during the moulting processes. ©2005 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {A microcosm experiment was carried out to study the influence of lead and zinc, individually and in mixtures, on a free-living nematode community of a Tunisian lagoon. Three levels (low, medium and high) of each heavy metal were used, separately and in combinations, for sediment contamination and effects were examined after two months. Results from the multiple comparison tests showed significant differences between nematode assemblages from undisturbed controls and those from lead and/or zinc treatments. Most univariate measures, including diversity and species richness, decreased significantly in the treated microcosms. Results from multivariate analyses of the species abundance data revealed significant effects of both metals, separately or in mixtures, at all the doses tested on nematode assemblages. All treatments were significantly different from the control and from each other. Both univariate and multivariate analyses of the data showed that the differential response occurred in all treatments but the communities from microcosms contaminated with lead and zinc separately were much more strongly affected. This result is suggestive of antagonistic interactions between Pb and Zn. The responses of nematode species to the lead and zinc treatments were varied: Calomicrolaimus honestus was eliminated at all lead doses tested and seemed to be intolerant species to Pb contamination whereas Oncholaimus campylocercoides increased significantly at low and medium lead contamination, was eliminated in Pb-highly amended sediment treatments and increased at all zinc doses used. This species could be categorized as "opportunistic" at low and medium lead doses and "zinc-resistant" species. Hypodontolaimus colesi was eliminated in all replicates treated with Zn even at low concentration and appeared to be a very sensitive species to zinc contamination. ©2007 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Diatoms usually dominate microphytobenthic biofilms in coastal and estuarine intertidal environments. Yet, functional studies on biofilms often skip species analysis because benthic diatoms are notoriously difficult to extract from sediments and challenging to identify at that taxonomic level. Valid, less time-consuming alternatives would surely be welcomed and increase the inclusion of community structure information in microphytobenthos (MPB) ecophysiological studies. Starting with an original 181-species abundances matrix (OSM), obtained during a 2-year spatial–temporal survey in a Tagus Estuary intertidal flat with contrasting sediment textures, the current study assessed the effectiveness of several approaches to species abundances analysis. The effect of excluding abundance data or rare species, the influence of taxonomic resolution, or the use of size-based metrics on biotic multivariate patterns was examined by an objective comparison that replicated these different approaches on three different levels: (1) inter-matrix correlations, (2) performance in several non-parametric multivariate analyses (ANOSIM, MDS), and (3) correlations with the environmental dataset. When compared with the OSM, all matrices had strong or very strong positive correlations. All discriminated successfully spatial patterns, separating well assemblages from sandy and muddy sediments, and all had significant correlations with the environmental dataset. Apart from the relative biovolume species matrix (BSM), only the species matrices were able to discriminate significantly temporal patterns. The exclusion of the rarest species (48% of total) had a negligible effect, with the common and original species abundances matrices having a ρ > 0.99 correlation. Of the alternative approaches to species abundances, species presence/absence and the genera abundances matrices yielded the best results overall. Genera presence/absence and the size-class matrices had intermediate performances, with the former performing comparatively poorly with regard to seasonal patterns. BSM had the lowest correlation with the environmental variable dataset (ρ = 0.598) and the worst overall performance in the other multivariate routines. This means that either a high-taxonomic resolution qualitative analysis (i.e. species presence/absence) or, in alternatively, a genus-level analysis retaining abundance data may be sufficient to describe basic spatial differences in estuarine intertidal flats. However, if seasonal variations in mudflat diatom assemblage structure are to be detected, species-level abundance data are still necessary.},

Using free and openly accessible Landsat satellite imagery archives over 35 years (1984–2019), this study explores the potential of remote sensing for detection and long-term monitoring of green macroalgae blooms. By using a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script, we were able to detect and quantify green tide surfaces using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) at four highly affected beaches in Northern Brittany. Mean green tide coverage was derived and analyzed from 1984 to 2019, at both monthly and annual scales. Our results show important interannual and seasonal fluctuations in estimated macroalgae cover. In terms of trends over time, green tide events did not show a decrease in extent at three out of four studied sites. The observed decrease in nitrogen concentrations for the rivers draining the study sites has not resulted in a reduction of green tide extents.},

Benthic fluxes of CO2, O2, NO3- and NH4+ were measured regularly. Thirteen days after setup the microcosms were sacrificed and sediment characteristics, pore water NO3-, NH4+ and exchangeable NH4+ concentrations, and potential nitrification activity were measured. The presence of C. volutator increased overall mineralization processes due to burrow construction and irrigation. The amphipods increased the ratio $Σ$CO2/O2 fluxes from 0.73 to 0.86 in microcosms inhabited by 0 and 6000 ind m-2, respectively. Burrow ventilation removed NH4+ from the sediment, which was nitrified in the oxic layer and transported NO3- to the burrow sediment, where denitrification potential was enhanced. Nitrification and total denitrification rates (denitrification of NO3- coming from the overlying water and of NO3- generated within the sediment) were calculated and discussed. Bioturbation by C. volutator increased both nitrification and denitrification, but denitrification was stimulated more than nitrification. Denitrification of NO3- coming from the overlying water was stimulated 1.2- and 1.7-fold in microcosms containing 3000 and 6000 ind m-2 relative to control microcosms.

To characterize algae assemblages, multivariate analyses were performed (multidimensional scaling [MDS] ordination and clustering), supported by correlations between structural variables. Microphytobenthos, dominated by 97% diatoms belonging to 89 taxa, was constituted by two main assemblages: The first one, composed of common species (occurrence >50%), mainly nanobenthic (size <30 μm) and epipsammic (sand-fixed cells), was associated with mixed sediments. The major species contributing to this assemblage were Navicula perminuta, Achnanthes hauckiana, Fallacia tenera, A. lanceolata var. elleptica, Amphora spp., Plagiogrammopsis vanheurkii, and Plagiogramma tenuissimum (see Table 2 for taxonomic authors). Species diversity was high (N1 ∼ 11), often linked to high biomass values (>70 mg chl a·m-2) and low detritus ratio. Conversely, the second assemblage comprised occasional species (occurrence from 10% to 50%), mainly microbenthic (>30 μm) and epipelic (moving cells), occurring during summer at muddy sites. This assemblage, characterized by low diversity, high biomass variability, and high detritus ratio, was dominated by Scolioneis tumida or Plagiotropis vitrea and Navicula spartinetensis. Whereas hydrodynamics globally explained the gradual assemblage changes throughout the entire mudflat and the year, oyster beds and ridge and runnel features appeared to be local spatial structuring factors allowing the establishment of specific assemblages. This study suggests a significant role for epipsammon biomass, until now underestimated, in the functioning of this turbid coastal ecosystem. © 2007 Phycological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Recent studies suggest that water hyacinths can influence the transport of macroplastics in freshwater ecosystems at tropical latitudes. Forming large patches of several meters at the water surface, water hyacinths can entrain and aggregate large amounts of floating debris, including plastic items. Research on this topic is still novel and few studies have quantified the role of the water hyacinths in plastic transport. In this study, we present the findings of a six-week monitoring campaign, combining the use of visual observations and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle imagery in the Saigon river, Vietnam. For the first time, we provide observational evidence that the majority of macroplastic is transported by water hyacinth patches. Over the study period, these fast-growing and free-floating water plants transported 78% of the macroplastics observed. Additionally, we present insights on the spatial distribution of plastic and hyacinths across the river width, and the different characteristics of entrapped items compared with free-floating ones. With this study, we demonstrate the role of water hyacinths as a river plastic aggregator, which is crucial for improving the understanding of plastic transport, and optimizing future monitoring and collection strategies.},

   abstract = {Estuaries have long been regarded as environmentally naturally stressed areas because of the high degree of variability in their physico-chemical characteristics, for example oxygen, temperature and salinity in the water column and bed sediment dynamics. However, their biota is well-adapted to cope with that stress and so the areas may be regarded as resilient because of that inherent variability; their ability to absorb stress without adverse effects is regarded here as Environmental Homeostasis. Hence these areas may only be regarded as stressful for marine or freshwater-adapted organisms and that for estuarine organisms this environmental stress is regarded as a subsidy whereby they successfully capitalise on the stressful conditions. In addition, using examples of the estuarine fauna and flora, this article indicates that the characteristics of natural stress in estuaries are similar to those for anthropogenic stress. An over-reliance on ecosystem structural features, such as diversity, in quality indicators therefore makes the detection of the anthropogenic stress more difficult. This difficulty is termed the Estuarine Quality Paradox. Because of these difficulties, the article argues that functional characteristics either as well as or rather than structural ones should be used in detecting environmental perturbations in estuaries. ©2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) is composed of unicellular photosynthetic organisms that colonize intertidal sediments within the first millimeters of the photic zone and form biofilms at low tide. In estuaries, this benthic group can represent the main primary producer and deliver several ecosystem services. However, it is not currently used as a bioindicator of water quality, contrary to the widespread use of phytobenthos in freshwater settings. This study assesses the potential of developing MBP metrics to assess water quality in transitional waters using Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery. A Random Forest machine learning classification was used to distinguish different types of intertidal vegetation in 26 French estuaries and bays, in particular MPB and green macroalgae (chlorophytes), using multispectral indices. High accuracy was generally achieved for the identification of MPB when compared with field validation data, for both User's and Producer's accuracies, which corresponded to 94% and 84% respectively. Two Earth observation variables were retrieved: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy of MPB biomass, and MPB percent cover integrated over the entire intertidal area of the water body. From a total of 918 S2 images from over a full year, 28% were exploitable due to the combined requirements of cloud-free pixels collected during low tide. With its 10 m spatial resolution, S2 was able to map all estuaries. MPB percent cover showed a stronger gradient between estuaries than MPB NDVI. MPB percent cover was also significantly correlated with green macroalgae percent cover, and a group of estuaries characterized by the highest MPB and green macroalgae coverage corresponded to eutrophic sites impacted by intensive farming activities. A multivariate analysis confirmed that MPB percent cover was indeed related to nutrients. It was also related to sediment type which was one of the main factors underlying differences between estuaries. This work is a first step toward a water quality metric using MPB, and several recommendations are proposed to refine this approach. Sentinel-2 imagery, which is publicly available, presents an interesting compromise to map estuarine microphytobenthos in order to assess the ecological status of transitional waters.},

The assessment of sediment-water interfaces is essential to understand nutrient dynamics and to evaluate the vulnerability to eutrophication, especially in regions of restricted water exchange (RRE), such as the Ria Formosa, which have natural conditions for the accumulation of nutrients. Water samples were collected during the years of 2006 and 2007-08 for nutrients, chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen. Sediment samples were also collected for pore water nutrients and microphytobenthic chlorophyll a. Measurements of temperature, salinity and photosynthetic active radiation were also taken. The lagoon salinity is affected by occasional strong rainfall events. From comparison with previous work, a decrease in the nitrogen concentration in the water column can be observed, which may indicate an improvement of the water quality. Pore water nutrient concentrations were significantly larger than in the water column. Sediment-water exchanges are considered to be the most important processes in nutrient dynamics of the lagoon. Benthic microalgal biomass was also large compared with that of the phytoplankton. It represents about 99% of the total microalgal chlorophyll biomass of the system. The lagoon also contains (discontinuous) meadows of intertidal seagrass, but we did not study these. Due to the importance of sediments, the standard monitoring plans required by the Water Framework Directive may fail to track changes in the nutrient conditions and the microalgal responses to them. ©2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The MPB are essential components of soft-sediment systems, but are often overlooked when assessing coastal ecosystem functionality and service delivery. The MPB are involved in several complex interactions and feedback that underpin the delivery of vital ecosystem services. MPB profoundly influence the flow and cycling of carbon and nutrients, such as nitrogen, directly and indirectly underpinning highly productive shallow water marine food webs. The MPB can also stabilize sediments through the formation of biofilms, and significantly improve water quality by mediating the benthic–pelagic coupling of nutrients, sediment and pollutants. The functional role of the MPB is compromised by increasing anthropogenic pressures such as nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, herbicides and emerging contaminants such as microplastic pollution. However, MPB are extremely good at buffering the effects of these land-sourced stressors at the interface between land and sea. Synthesis. Society often appreciates the final provisioning of goods and services from our coastal marine environments. However, provisioning services are only possible due to the multitude of supporting and regulating services that underpin them. Microphytobenthos (MPB) are central to benthic ecological networks, and contribute to ecosystem service delivery through various pathways. Understanding the critical role of MPB in complex networks is therefore essential to appreciate their importance in ecosystem function and service delivery into the future.},

   abstract = {In most cases, eutrophication of a coastal zone is a multi-source phenomenon. The questions often raised by authorities about these different sources are: what are their marine area of influence and their respective role in the eutrophication process? A first answer to these questions is proposed for the bay of Biscay-English Channel French coasts, using a hydrodynamical model alone with a passive tracer for each of the main 45 French watersheds of the domain. The statistical marine receiving area of each river is then defined over a whole decade (2000–2010) by using different percentiles (respectively the 10th, 50th, 90th ones) of the distribution of tracer values in each mesh of the grid: this enables to map the dilution areas of each river plume respectively for low water regime, mean flow rate regime and flood regime. If one can impose: 1/the marine winter concentration not to be exceeded to keep a Good Ecological Status, 2/a proxy for the cost of the unitary abatement of the nutrient concentration in each river, this linear dilution model can be coupled to a global optimisation method, in order to compute the set of concentrations in the 45 rivers which allows to obtain at the lowest price the best Ecological Status everywhere in the maritime domain under consideration. Two global optimisation techniques (linear Simplex method and quadratic Beale's method) have been compared on various marine target areas: the marine WFD water masses considered separately or together, the 3 MSFD French sub-regions of the Channel-Biscay area, or the coastal strip laying between the seashore and the 50 m isobath. Computations have been made using two successive nitrate and phosphate thresholds at sea, which are associated respectively to the WFD eutrophication High Status and Good Status. This exercise has shown that focusing on a single small marine target area can sometimes prescribe a strong abatement of concentrations in the sole small neighbouring rivers, but that dealing with a large marine target area points always to the biggest tributaries as being the main nutrient sources to be diminished, whereas small tributaries can be neglected. As it contains the whole big river plumes, the MSFD target requires stronger abatement of nitrate in some watersheds than the WFD target, which is limited to a thin, 1 nautical mile wide strip along the coasts. Whereas very few rivers (e.g. the Seine river) require some abatement of their phosphate loadings, almost all the medium and large French rivers would require very strong abatements (between 50 and 80%) of their nitrate concentrations. To verify this quick linear approach restricted to winter nutrients, a full non-linear, coupled biogeochemical-hydrodynamical model has been used to compute the effect of these optimal nutrient reduction scenarios on the most characteristic descriptors of eutrophication: chlorophyll 90th percentile, dinoflagellate maximum and bottom oxygen concentration 10th percentile. The results show that nutrient loading reductions enabling a Good Ecological Status everywhere for winter marine nutrients would still leave some marine areas in a Bad Ecological Status in terms of chlorophyll content.},

These microbial assemblages form transient biofilms at the sediment surface and have important ecosystem functions. MPB biofilms are well known to exhibit high microscale patchiness whereas meso- and macroscale spatio-temporal structures are little known. In this work, satellite remote sensing was used to map MPB assemblages at such scales. MPB interannual distribution was investigated in the poly- and mesohaline domain of the north-European estuary (Loire estuary), using a multispectral SPOT image time series (1991-2009). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated from two SPOT channels, XS2 and XS3, (red and near-infrared wavelengths, respectively). MPB biofilms were identified by NDVI values between 0 and 0.3. At the scale of the whole intertidal area, the results showed that MPB biofilms in the Loire estuary exhibited perennial structures in both the polyhaline and mesohaline sectors, occupying nearly 90% of the mudflat surfaces. MPB biofilm density was closely associated with intertidal position, with thicker biofilms developing mostly in the upper and middle shore, and formed kilometric longitudinal structures parallel to the shoreline. Mean NDVI values showed a strong positive correlation with mean seasonal air temperature (. τ = 0.714, p < 0.05 in the polyhaline domain and τ = 0.810, p < 0.05 in the mesohaline domain), with a strong correlation in the upper intertidal mudflat (between +3 and 4 m isobaths). Negative wind effect was mainly detected in the upper intertidal areas, particularly between the +3 and 4 m isobaths (. τ = -0.810, p < 0.05 in the polyhaline domain and τ = -0.910 in the mesohaline).},

Nonparametric multivariate analyses were used to characterize spatial and temporal patterns of the assemblages and to link them to the measured environmental variables. In addition, diversity and other features related to community physiognomy, such as size-class or life-form distributions, were used to describe the diatom assemblages. A total of 183 diatom taxa were identified during cell counts and their biovolume was determined. Differences between stations (analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), R = 0.932) were more evident than temporal patterns (R = 0.308) and mud content alone was the environmental variable most correlated to the biotic data (BEST, ρ = 0.863). Mudflat stations were typically colonized by low diversity diatom assemblages (H′ ~ 1.9), mainly composed of medium-sized motile epipelic species (250-1,000 μm3), that showed species-specific seasonal blooms (e.g., Navicula gregaria Donkin). Sandy stations had more complex and diverse diatom assemblages (H′ ~ 3.2). They were mostly composed by a large set of minute epipsammic species (<250 μm3) that, generally, did not show temporal patterns. The structure of intertidal diatom assemblages was largely defined by the interplay between epipelon and epipsammon, and its diversity was explained within the framework of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis. However, the spatial distribution of epipelic and epipsammic life-forms showed that the definition of both functional groups should not be over-simplified. © 2012 Phycological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Intertidal marine systems are highly dynamic systems which are characterized by periodic fluctuations in environmental parameters. Microbial processes play critical roles in the remineralization of nutrients and primary production in intertidal systems. Many of the geochemical and biological processes which are mediated by microorganisms occur within microenvironments which can be measured over micrometer spatial scales. These processes are localized by cells within a matrix of extracellular polymeric secretions (EPS), collectively called a 'microbial biofilm'. Recent examinations of intertidal systems by a range of investigators using new approaches show an abundance of biofilm communities. The purpose of this overview is to examine recent information concerning the roles of microbial biofilms in intertidal systems. The microbial biofilm is a common adaptation of natural bacteria and other microorganisms. In the fluctuating environments of intertidal systems, biofilms form protective microenvironments and may structure a range of microbial processes. The EPS matrix of biofilm forms sticky coatings on individual sediment particles and detrital surfaces, which act as a stabilizing anchor to buffer cells and their extracellular processes during the frequent physical stresses (e.g., changes in salinity and temperature, UV irradiation, dessication). EPS is an operational definition designed to encompass a range of large microbially-secreted molecules having widely varying physical and chemical properties, and a range of biological roles. Examinations of EPS using Raman and Fourier-transform infared spectroscopy, and atomic-force microscopy suggest that some EPS gels possess physical and chemical properties which may hasten the development of sharp geochemical gradients, and contribute a protective effect to cells. Biofilm polymers act as a sorptive sponge which binds and concentrates organic molecules and ions close to cells. Concurrently, the EPS appear to localize extracellular enzyme activities of bacteria, and hence contribute to the efficient biomineralization of organics. At larger spatial scales, the copious secretion of specific types of EPS by diatoms on the surfaces of intertidal mudflats may stabilize sediments against resuspension. Biofilms exert important roles in environmental- and public health processes occurring within intertidal systems. The sorptive properties of EPS effectively chelate toxic metals and other contaminants, which then act as an efficient trophic-transfer vehicle for the entry of contaminants into food webs. In the water column, biofilm microenvironments in suspended flocs may form a stabilizing refugia that enhances the survival and propagation of pathogenic (i.e., disease-causing) bacteria entering coastal waters from terrestrial and freshwater sources. The EPS matrix affords microbial cells a tremendous potential for resiliency during periods of stress, and may enhance the overall physiological activities of bacteria. It is emphasized here that the influences of small-scale microbial biofilms must be addressed in understanding larger-scale processes within intertidal systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Microphytobenthos (MPB) from intertidal mudflats are key primary producers at the land-ocean interface. MPB can be more productive than phytoplankton and sustain both benthic and pelagic higher trophic levels. The objective of this study is to assess the contribution of light, mud temperature, and gastropod Peringia ulvae grazing pressure in shaping the seasonal MPB dynamics on the Brouage mudflat (NW France). We use a physical-biological coupled model applied to the sediment first centimeter for the year 2008. The simulated data compare to observations including time-coincident remotely sensed and in situ data. The model suggests a MPB annual cycle characterized by a main spring bloom, a biomass depression in summer, and a moderate fall bloom. In early spring, high simulated photosynthetic rates due to mud surface temperature (MST) values close to the MPB temperature optimum for photosynthesis and to increasing solar irradiance trigger the onset of the MPB spring bloom. After the bloom, high MST values lead to synoptic events when MPB thermo-inhibition (39.5% of summer) and limitation by P. ulvae grazing (8.7% of summer) superimpose. During these synoptic events of thermo-inhibition and grazing combination, 14% of the simulated annual MPB primary production is channeled towards the P. ulvae secondary production through ingestion. The model suggests that such a combined effect is highly linked to the MPB biomass depression in summer. The model ability to infer on biotic and abiotic mechanisms driving the seasonal MPB dynamics could open the door to a new assessment of the export flux of biogenic matter at the land-ocean interface and, more generally, of the contribution of productive intertidal biofilms to the coastal carbon cycle.},

This is the first attempt to use remote sensing to study MPB in an ecosystem with a Mediterranean-like climate. Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) images were used to map benthic microalgae through the application of a Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI). A significant relationship between in-situ benthic chlorophyll a measurements and SPOT NDVI values was used to derive a map for biomass spatial distribution.At the scale of the whole intertidal area, NDVI time-series from 2003 revealed that MPB showed clear temporal variations, with lower values observed in summer compared to winter. This seasonal trend was found both in the SPOT and MERIS images and may be the result of extreme high temperatures that inhibit MPB growth. The main MPB biofilms were spatially stable through time at a large scale. Maximum NDVI values during the winter were found in the high shore with decreasing NDVI values towards the low shore. MPB light limitation at the lowest bathymetries is likely to occur in winter due to the high turbidity of Tagus estuary.The biomass spatial distribution map, obtained for January 2003, indicated low values ranging from 0 to 20mgChl am-2 for the lower shores, while in the upper shore biomass varied between 60 and 80mg Chlam-2.

   abstract = {The dynamics of diatoms and dinoflagellates have been monitored for many decades at the Helgoland Roads Long-Term Ecological Research site and are relatively well understood. In contrast, small-sized eukaryotic microbes and their community changes are still much more elusive, mainly due to their small size and uniform morphology, which makes them difficult to identify microscopically. By using next-generation sequencing, we wanted to shed light on the Helgoland planktonic community dynamics, including nano- and picoplankton, during a spring bloom. We took samples from March to May 2016 and sequenced the V4 region of the 18S rDNA. Our results showed that mixotrophic and heterotrophic taxa were more abundant than autotrophic diatoms. Dinoflagellates dominated the sequence assemblage, and several small-sized eukaryotic microbes like Haptophyta, Choanoflagellata, Marine Stramenopiles and Syndiniales were identified. A diverse background community including taxa from all size classes was present during the whole sampling period. Five phases with several communities were distinguished. The fastest changes in community composition took place in phase 3, while the communities from phases 1 to 5 were more similar to each other despite contrasting environmental conditions. Synergy effects of next-generation sequencing and traditional methods may be exploited in future long-term observations.},

   abstract = {Nature's silicon marvel, the diatoms have lately astounded the scientific community with its intricate designs and lasting durability. Diatoms are a major group of phytoplanktons involved in the biogeochemical cycling of silica and are virtually inherent in every environment ranging from water to ice to soil. The usage of diatoms has proved prudently cost effective and its handling neither requires costly materials nor sophisticated instruments. Diatoms can easily be acquired from the environment, their culture requires ambient condition and does not involve any costly media or expensive instruments, besides, they can be transported in small quantities and proliferated to a desirable confluence from that scratch, thus are excellent cost effective industrial raw material. Naturally occurring diatom frustules are a source of nanomaterials. Their silica bio-shells have raised curiosity among nanotechnologists who hope that diatoms will facilitate tailoring minuscule structures which are beyond the capabilities of material scientists. Additionally, there is a colossal diversity in the dimensions of diatoms as the frustule shape differs from species to species; this provides a scope for the choice of a particular species of diatom to be tailored to an exacting requisite, thus paving the way to create desired three dimensional nanocomposites. The present article explores the use of diatoms in various arenas of science, may it be in nanotechnology, biotechnology, environmental science, biophysics or biochemistry and summarizes facets of diatom biology under one umbrella. Special emphasis has been given to biosilicification, biomineralization and use of diatoms as nanomaterials', drug delivery vehicles, optical and immune-biosensors, filters, immunodiagnostics, aquaculture feeds, lab-on-a-chip, metabolites, and biofuels.},

   abstract = {Abstract The current decrease in biodiversity affects all ecosystems, and the impacts of diversity on ecosystem functioning need to be resolved. So far, marine studies about diversity–ecosystem productivity-relationships have concentrated on small-scale, controlled experiments, with often limited relevance to natural ecosystems. Here, we provide a real-world study on the effects of microorganismal diversity (measured as the diversity of benthic diatom communities) on ecosystem productivity (using chlorophyll a concentration as a surrogate) in a heterogeneous marine coastal archipelago. We collected 78 sediment cores at 17 sites in the northern Baltic Sea and found exceptionally high diatom diversity (328 observed species). We used structural equation models and quantile regression to explore relationships between diatom diversity and productivity. Previous studies have found contradictory results in the relationship between microorganismal diversity and ecosystem productivity, but we showed a linear and positive basal relationship between diatom diversity and productivity, which indicates that diatom diversity most likely forms the lowest boundary for productivity. Thus, although productivity can be high even when diatom diversity is low, high diatom diversity supports high productivity. The trait composition was more effective than taxonomical composition in showing such a relationship, which could be due to niche complementarity. Our results also indicated that environmental heterogeneity leads to substantial patchiness in the diversity of benthic diatom communities, mainly induced by the variation in sediment organic matter content. Therefore, future changes in precipitation and river runoff and associated changes in the quality and quantity of organic matter in the sea, will also affect diatom communities and, hence, ecosystem productivity. Our study suggests that benthic microorganisms are vital for ecosystem productivity, and together with the substantial heterogeneity of coastal ecosystems, they should be considered when evaluating the potential productivity of coastal areas.},

   abstract = {Abstract Sediment dwelling, microscopic primary producers, that occupy sediments in the photic zone, are commonly referred to as microphytobenthos (MPB). The MPB are essential components of soft-sediment systems, but are often overlooked when assessing coastal ecosystem functionality and service delivery. The MPB are involved in several complex interactions and feedback that underpin the delivery of vital ecosystem services. MPB profoundly influence the flow and cycling of carbon and nutrients, such as nitrogen, directly and indirectly underpinning highly productive shallow water marine food webs. The MPB can also stabilize sediments through the formation of biofilms, and significantly improve water quality by mediating the benthic–pelagic coupling of nutrients, sediment and pollutants. The functional role of the MPB is compromised by increasing anthropogenic pressures such as nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, herbicides and emerging contaminants such as microplastic pollution. However, MPB are extremely good at buffering the effects of these land-sourced stressors at the interface between land and sea. Synthesis. Society often appreciates the final provisioning of goods and services from our coastal marine environments. However, provisioning services are only possible due to the multitude of supporting and regulating services that underpin them. Microphytobenthos (MPB) are central to benthic ecological networks, and contribute to ecosystem service delivery through various pathways. Understanding the critical role of MPB in complex networks is therefore essential to appreciate their importance in ecosystem function and service delivery into the future.},

   abstract = {1. Knowledge of global patterns of biodiversity and regulating variables is indispensable to develop predictive models. 2. The present study used predictive modelling approaches to investigate hypotheses that explain the variation in fish species richness between estuaries over a worldwide spatial extent. Ultimately, such models will allow assessment of future changes in ecosystem structure and function as a result of environmental changes. 3. A comprehensive worldwide data base was compiled of the fish assemblage composition and environmental characteristics of estuaries. Generalized Linear Models were used to quantify how variation in species richness among estuaries is related to historical events, energy dynamics and ecosystem characteristics, while controlling for sampling effects. 4. At the global extent, species richness differed among marine biogeographic realms and continents and increased with mean sea surface temperature, terrestrial net primary productivity and the stability of connectivity with a marine ecosystem (open vs. temporarily open estuaries). At a smaller extent (within a marine biogeographic realm or continent), other characteristics were also important in predicting variation in species richness, with species richness increasing with estuary area and continental shelf width. 5. The results suggest that species richness in an estuary is defined by predictors that are spatially hierarchical. Over the largest spatial extents, species richness is influenced by the broader distributions and habitat use patterns of marine and freshwater species that can colonize estuaries, which are in turn governed by history contingency, energy dynamics and productivity variables. Species richness is also influenced by more regional and local parameters that can further affect the process of community colonization in an estuary including the connectivity of the estuary with the adjacent marine habitat, and, over smaller spatial extents, the size of these habitats. In summary, patterns of species richness in estuaries across large spatial extents seem to reflect from global to local processes acting on community colonization. The importance of considering spatial extent, sampling effects and of combining history and contemporary environmental characteristics when exploring biodiversity is highlighted.},

   abstract = {Increasing human populations around the global coastline have caused extensive loss, degradation and fragmentation of coastal ecosystems, threatening the delivery of important ecosystem services(1). As a result, alarming losses of mangrove, coral reef, seagrass, kelp forest and coastal marsh ecosystems have occurred(1-6). However, owing to the difficulty of mapping intertidal areas globally, the distribution and status of tidal flats-one of the most extensive coastal ecosystems-remain unknown(7). Here we present an analysis of over 700,000 satellite images that maps the global extent of and change in tidal flats over the course of 33 years (1984-2016). We find that tidal flats, defined as sand, rock or mud flats that undergo regular tidal inundation(7), occupy at least 127,921 km(2) (124,286-131,821 km(2), 95% confidence interval). About 70% of the global extent of tidal flats is found in three continents (Asia (44% of total), North America (15.5% of total) and South America (11% of total)), with 49.2% being concentrated in just eight countries (Indonesia, China, Australia, the United States, Canada, India, Brazil and Myanmar). For regions with sufficient data to develop a consistent multi-decadal time series-which included East Asia, the Middle East and North America-we estimate that 16.02% (15.62-16.47%, 95% confidence interval) of tidal flats were lost between 1984 and 2016. Extensive degradation from coastal development(1), reduced sediment delivery from major rivers(8,9), sinking of riverine deltas(8,10), increased coastal erosion and sea-level rise(11) signal a continuing negative trajectory for tidal flat ecosystems around the world. Our high-spatial-resolution dataset delivers global maps of tidal flats, which substantially advances our understanding of the distribution, trajectory and status of these poorly known coastal ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Measurements of net photosynthesis of benthic estuarine diatoms were made by polarographic registration of oxygen saturation. A measuring cell was constructed in which media with salinities of 2.0 to 100.7‰ were pumped over the algae between measurements. Diatoms from unialgal cultures and mixed populations from intertidal flats appeared to be highly tolerant of extreme salinities. During short-term exposures (20 min) the net photosynthesis of the algae did not drop below 70% of the initial values, within the salinity range 4.0 to 60.0‰. Prolonged exposure (up to 6 h) gave essentially the same results. Populations of benthic diatoms, sampled from field stations with mean salinities of about 30, 12, and below 5‰, showed only gradual differences in their tolerance of salinities between 2.0 and 33.7‰. Two species, Navicula arenaria and Nitzschia sigma, were cultured in media ranging in salinity from 8.0 to 45.0‰ and from 2.0 to 45‰, respectively. The tolerance to changing salinity was only slightly affected by the salinity of the medium in the preculture. The role of salinity in the production and distribution of intertidal diatoms is discussed.},

These 5 communities corresponded to 5 different hydro-ecoregions, i.e. 5 river types with similar geological context and range in altitude. The 6 other communities were typical of rivers under anthropogenic pressure. The influence of natural conditions within the hydro-ecoregions was overwhelmed by the nature and the intensity of the pollution at the sampling stations. This work was done in the context of the application and enforcement of the Water Framework Directive.},

Behavioral vertical migration was hypothesized as being controlled by exogenous factors (tide and light) but also by endogenous factors (carbon and nitrogen requirements). The secretion of Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) during photosynthesis (overflow metabolism) and migration of diatoms was also formulated. Similarities in MPB dynamics between observations and simulations support the assumption that carbon and nitrogen ratios are additional key processes behind the vertical migration of diatoms in the sediment. The model satisfactorily reproduced the three growth phases of the MPB development observed in a mesocosm (the lag phase, the logarithmic growth, and the plateau). Besides, nutrient availability, which could be induced by faunal bioturbation, significantly determined the extent of MPB biomass and development. The plateau phase observed in the last days of simulations appeared to be attributed to a nutrient depletion in the system, emphasizing the importance of nutrient availability. The model, although improvable especially on the formulation of the EPS excretion and bacteria development, already updated understanding of several aspects of benthic-system functioning during experimental conditions.},

   abstract = {Microplastics (MP) constitute a widespread contaminant all over the globe. Rivers and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) transport annually several million tons of MP into freshwaters, estuaries and oceans, where they provide increasing artificial surfaces for microbial colonization. As knowledge on MP-attached communities is insufficient for brackish ecosystems, we conducted exposure experiments in the coastal Baltic Sea, an in-flowing river and a WWTP within the drainage basin. While reporting on prokaryotic and fungal communities from the same set-up previously, we focus here on the entire eukaryotic communities. Using high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the eukaryotes colonizing on two types of MP, polyethylene and polystyrene, and compared them to the ones in the surrounding water and on a natural surface (wood). More than 500 different taxa across almost all kingdoms of the eukaryotic tree of life were identified on MP, dominated by Alveolata, Metazoa, and Chloroplastida. The eukaryotic community composition on MP was significantly distinct from wood and the surrounding water, with overall lower diversity and the potentially harmful dinoflagellate Pfiesteria being enriched on MP. Co-occurrence networks, which include prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa, hint at possibilities for dynamic microbial interactions on MP. This first report on total eukaryotic communities on MP in brackish environments highlights the complexity of MP-associated biofilms, potentially leading to altered microbial activities and hence changes in ecosystem functions.},

Analysis of a 30year data set (1981–2010) for the Colne estuary, a hypernutrified estuary in the south-east of England, revealed significant reductions in nutrient concentrations in freshwater inputs and along the estuarine gradient linked to management actions. DIN concentrations decreased, mainly as a result of reduced ammonia outputs from Colchester STW and reduced nitrate loads from the catchment. Declines in phosphate concentrations occurred due to improved STW processes. There were significant declines in phytoplankton chlorophyll a over the period. Long-term trajectories of nutrient decreases were also strongly influenced by interannual patterns of rainfall and climatic signals (winter NAO). Standardised winter DIN concentrations in the Colne estuary significantly exceed the Water Framework Directive good status target, but the estuary shows no symptoms of eutrophication.},

   abstract = {Abstract Recently, studies about the spatial distribution of microbial species and communities have increased substantially. Freshwater diatoms are used as one of the most popular model taxa in such macroecological studies, but the most exciting patterns in the spatial ecology of diatoms have not been reviewed. Here, we identify 15 important questions about freshwater diatom ecology, review the major findings, and suggest novel research avenues. We found that diatoms do not support classical latitudinal diversity gradient, species–area relationship or Rapoport's rule. We found some, albeit inconsistent support for an elevational diversity gradient, Bergmann's rule and niche conservation. Diatoms do support a positive interspecific abundance–occupancy relationship like nearly all other taxa. With regards to metacommunity dynamics, diatom communities are typically structured by species sorting, but neutral dynamics or mass effects are also evident at large or small spatial scale, respectively. Taken together, this review suggests that diatoms follow some classical biogeographical patterns similarly to larger taxa, but patterns are typically weaker than for macro-organisms. This may result because diatoms are typically relatively strongly controlled by local factors and often exhibit efficient stochastic dispersal processes both at small and large scales. More research is needed to build a more comprehensive view of diatom species–area relationships and latitudinal gradients in diversity, for example. In the future, well-replicated macroecological field experiments, diatom studies with intercontinental or global coverage, trait-based approaches, and DNA-based species identification would be fruitful avenues to shed more light into the spatial ecology of diatoms.},

Essentially, the method consists of drying material onto coverslips and cleaning it directly in situ using nitric acid (or hydrogen peroxide), which is evaporated to dryness. After washing twice or a few times with deionized water, the coverslips are ready for mounting in resin for light microscopy as usual, or attachment to stubs for scanning electron microscopy. Besides speed, the method has the advantage that it often preserves some frustules intact or leaves their different elements (and stages of valve formation) closely associated with each other. Examples where the method is especially advantageous are to clean small aliquots of cultures for identification or to act as vouchers, or to explore diversity of the most abundant species in natural material (e.g., periphyton). It is less suitable for counts in ecological or palaeoecological studies. We tabulate the many other cleaning methods to provide context for the new method described here.},

   abstract = {Bioindication has become an indispensable part of water quality monitoring in most countries of the world, with the presence and abundance of bioindicator taxa, mostly multicellular eukaryotes, used for biotic indices. In contrast, microbes (bacteria, archaea and protists) are seldom used as bioindicators in routine assessments, although they have been recognized for their importance in environmental processes. Recently, the use of molecular methods has revealed unexpected diversity within known functional groups and novel metabolic pathways that are particularly important in energy and nutrient cycling. In various habitats, microbial communities respond to eutrophication, metals, and natural or anthropogenic organic pollutants through changes in diversity and function. In this review, we evaluated the common trends in these changes, documenting that they have value as bioindicators and can be used not only for monitoring but also for improving our understanding of the major processes in lotic and lentic environments. Current knowledge provides a solid foundation for exploiting microbial taxa, community structures and diversity, as well as functional genes, in novel monitoring programs. These microbial community measures can also be combined into biotic indices, improving the resolution of individual bioindicators. Here, we assess particular molecular approaches complemented by advanced bioinformatic analysis, as these are the most promising with respect to detailed bioindication value. We conclude that microbial community dynamics are a missing link important for our understanding of rapid changes in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems, and should be addressed in the future environmental monitoring of freshwater ecosystems.},

   abstract = {The Earth's surface waters are a fundamental resource and encompass a broad range of ecosystems that are core to global biogeochemical cycling and food and energy production. Despite this, the Earth's surface waters are impacted by multiple natural and anthropogenic pressures and drivers of environmental change. The complex interaction between physical, chemical and biological processes in surface waters poses significant challenges for in situ monitoring and assessment and often limits our ability to adequately capture the dynamics of aquatic systems and our understanding of their status, functioning and response to pressures. Here we explore the opportunities that Earth observation (EO) has to offer to basin-scale monitoring of water quality over the surface water continuum comprising inland, transition and coastal water bodies, with a particular focus on the Danube and Black Sea region. This review summarises the technological advances in EO and the opportunities that the next generation satellites offer for water quality monitoring. We provide an overview of algorithms for the retrieval of water quality parameters and demonstrate how such models have been used for the assessment and monitoring of inland, transitional, coastal and shelf-sea systems. Further, we argue that very few studies have investigated the connectivity between these systems especially in large river-sea systems such as the Danube-Black Sea. Subsequently, we describe current capability in operational processing of archive and near real-time satellite data. We conclude that while the operational use of satellites for the assessment and monitoring of surface waters is still developing for inland and coastal waters and more work is required on the development and validation of remote sensing algorithms for these optically complex waters, the potential that these data streams offer for developing an improved, potentially paradigm-shifting understanding of physical and biogeochemical processes across large scale river-sea systems including the Danube-Black Sea is considerable.},

The fact that these are not open, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) severely hampers fast and efficient information flow to policy and decision-making that are required to tackle the current biodiversity crisis. Here, we propose a reproducible, semi-automated workflow to transform traditional checklist data into a FAIR and open species registry. We showcase our workflow by applying it to the publication of the Manual of Alien Plants, a species checklist specifically developed for the Tracking Invasive Alien Species (TrIAS) project. Our approach combines source data management, reproducible data transformation to Darwin Core using R, version control, data documentation and publication to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). This checklist publication workflow is openly available for data holders and applicable to species registries varying in thematic, taxonomic or geographical scope and could serve as an important tool to open up research and strengthen environmental decision-making.},

   abstract = {The high degree of physical factors in intertidal estuarine ecosystem increases material processing between benthic and pelagic compartments. In these ecosystems, microphytobenthos resuspension is a major phenomenon since its contribution to higher trophic levels can be highly significant. Understanding the sediment and associated microphytobenthos resuspension and its fate in the water column is indispensable for measuring the food available to benthic and pelagic food webs. To identify and hierarchize the physical/biological factors potentially involved in MPB resuspension, the entire intertidal area and surrounding water column of an estuarine ecosystem, the Bay des Veys, was sampled during ebb tide. A wide range of physical parameters (hydrodynamic regime, grain size of the sediment, and suspended matter) and biological parameters (flora and fauna assemblages, chlorophyll) were analyzed to characterize benthic-pelagic coupling at the bay scale. Samples were collected in two contrasted periods, spring and late summer, to assess the impact of forcing variables on benthic-pelagic coupling. A mapping approach using kriging interpolation enabled us to overlay benthic and pelagic maps of physical and biological variables, for both hydrological conditions and trophic indicators. Pelagic Chl a concentration was the best predictor explaining the suspension-feeders spatial distribution. Our results also suggest a perennial spatio-temporal structure of both benthic and pelagic compartments in the ecosystem, at least when the system is not imposed to intense wind, with MPB distribution controlled by both grain size and bathymetry. The benthic component appeared to control the pelagic one via resuspension phenomena at the scale of the bay. Co-inertia analysis showed closer benthic-pelagic coupling between the variables in spring. The higher MPB biomass observed in summer suggests a higher contribution to filter-feeders diets, indicating a higher resuspension effect in summer than in spring, in turn suggesting an important role of macrofauna bioturbation and filter feeding (Cerastoderma edule).},

The reference site had higher dissolved oxygen and turbidity values, the polluted sites greater conductivity, oxygen demands, phosphate, ammonium and nitrite values. Diatoms dominated the biofilms at the reference site; ciliates reached higher densities at the polluted sites. Significant differences were found in species numbers, species diversity index, biomass, tolerance to pollution of the taxa, and the Pampean Diatom Index, between the reference and the impacted sites.

   abstract = {Background: The Aegean Sea coast of Turkey hosts one of the most important nesting grounds for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Mediterranean Sea. Previous studies have revealed that the sea turtle carapace provides favourable conditions for various epibiontic organisms. Epibionts occurring on the carapace have been examined from different locations in the oceans. Methods: This is the first time such a high number (39) of samples collected from nesting turtles during such a long time period (extending from 2011 to 2018) has been used for the study of the diatom component of the microbiome on the turtle carapaces. A total of 33 samples were investigated in terms of light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Six unprocessed biofilm fragments were subject to SEM observations. Results: A total of 457 epizoic diatom taxa belonging to 86 genera were identified. Epizoic forms, e.g., Achnanthes spp., Chelonicola spp. or Tripterion spp. (also identified by SEM observations of the undisturbed pieces of the microbiome) dominated in terms of relative abundance, but the highest numbers of taxa were ubiquitously represented by Navicula (79), Nitzschia (45), Amphora (40), Cocconeis (32), Diploneis (25) and Mastogloia (23). Navicula perminuta and Delphineis australis were the most frequent taxa, present in 65% of the samples, both with an average relative abundance of 10%. The results of our study revealed that diatoms are an essential component of the loggerhead sea turtles' microbiome, in terms of high biodiversity and abundance. Although strict epibionts provide a signature of the turtle microbiome, the carapace as a solid substrate attracts numerous benthic diatom species which are considered opportunistic forms and can be found in the surrounding benthic habitats of the vast ocean littoral space.},

Furthermore, the microsystems (which have an open water area of less than 5 ha and a depth of less than 1 m) are compared with larger estuarine systems in the region, with the former representing one end of a continuum ranging from micro-outlets to large estuarine lakes and bays. In terms of the abiotic regime, the micro-outlets were dominated by oligohaline or freshwater conditions, while the micro-estuaries were mostly mesohaline. Relatively few freshwater-associated microalgae, zooplankton, macrozoobenthos and fish taxa were present in the micro-outlets, while a richer combination of freshwater and estuary-associated taxa dominated the micro-estuaries. Due to their small size and limited periods of abiotic stability, microsystems only serve as intermediate nursery areas for 0+ juveniles of estuary-associated marine fish which, after less than a year, migrate to nearby larger estuarine systems in order to complete their juvenile life stages. When compared to temporarily closed estuaries, predominantly open estuaries, estuarine lakes and estuarine bays, microsystems are depauperate in terms of typical estuarine and marine biota. However, further research is recommended on microsystems in southern Africa and globally, in order to define in greater detail their physico-chemical and biological characteristics.},

   abstract = {Despite important progress, uncertainty persists regarding the ecological forces driving microbial community assembly. Here, we present the first study to use phylogenetic information to interpret the structure and diversity of diatom communities. We examined local phylogenetic divergence and beta- phylogenetic diversity in a large dataset of 595 freshwater benthic diatom communities and we investigated how this diversity is influenced by gradients in nutrients, pH, organic matter and catchment size. Overall, we found that diatom communities were phylogenetically clustered, i.e. species within communities were more closely related than expected by chance. Phylogenetic clustering was stronger in nutrient-poor environments and in sites with a small catchment area. The variation of the phylogenetic beta-diversity index was much better explained by space and environment than the variation of the taxonomic index was. Both approaches detected a significant effect of environment and space on diatom community turnover. Our results support the view that diatom communities are primarily shaped by environmental filtering, in particular by nutrient availability. Moreover, they highlight the importance of considering dispersal-related processes and the depth of phylogenetic signal in functional traits when interpreting patterns of diversity.},

   abstract = {The kinetics of diatom growth on a mudflat in the Ems-Dollard estuary were analysed from field observations and experiments carried out during a spring bloom. Low-density natural populations of epipelic diatoms showed an exponential increase in cell number with an apparent cell division rate of 0·3 day−1. Similar division rates were measured in natural populations, incubated on their sediment in the laboratory and in unialgal cultures of dominant diatom species grown on interstitial water. The vertical migration of diatom cells in ‘dark’ millimeters deep sediment layers apparently did not decrease the mean cell division rate in the populations. The diatom populations on the mudflat reached densities of 1–×106 cells cm−2; these densities are comparable to peak values of chlorophyll a concentrations of 100–400 mg m−1 of sediment, as reported for microphytobenthos in the literature. In dense natural populations and in dense unialgal cultures similar patterns were found in the accumulation of biomass (as chlorophyll a or cell numbers), in the limitation of productivity (as mg O2 m−2 h−1) and in the decrease of cell division rate. The diffusion of inorganic carbon and oxygen between the diatom film and the overlying water limited the productivity of dense diatom populations to ca. 500 mg O2 h−1 or less depending on the external concentrations of inorganic carbon and oxygen, and the flow rate of the water. Correspondingly, the rate of cell production in dense culture reached an upper level and this resulted in linear growth curves. The rate of this linear growth was affected also by the length of the daily light period. At the highest densities of cultures and natural populations the population growth drops to zero, suggesting a per day balanced budget of carbon-limited photosynthesis and respiratory or excretory losses. Self-shading had no effect on the division rate in dense cultures. The supply of nutrients (as P, N or Si) was not a critical factor to the growth rate of natural populations on the nutriet-rich mudflat, nor to cultures under the conditions tested.},

   abstract = {In recent years, several sets of legislation worldwide (Oceans Act in USA, Australia or Canada; Water Framework Directive or Marine Strategy in Europe, National Water Act in South Africa, etc.) have been developed in order to address ecological quality or integrity, within estuarine and coastal systems. Most such legislation seeks to define quality in an integrative way, by using several biological elements, together with physico-chemical and pollution elements. Such an approach allows assessment of ecological status at the ecosystem level ('ecosystem approach' or 'holistic approach' methodologies), rather than at species level (e.g. mussel biomonitoring or Mussel Watch) or just at chemical level (i.e. quality objectives) alone. Increasing attention has been paid to the development of tools for different physico-chemical or biological (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos, algae, phanerogams, fishes) elements of the ecosystems. However, few methodologies integrate all the elements into a single evaluation of a water body. The need for such integrative tools to assess ecosystem quality is very important, both from a scientific and stakeholder point of view. Politicians and managers need information from simple and pragmatic, but scientifically sound methodologies, in order to show to society the evolution of a zone (estuary, coastal area, etc.), taking into account human pressures or recovery processes. These approaches include: (i) multidisciplinarity, inherent in the teams involved in their implementation; (ii) integration of biotic and abiotic factors; (iii) accurate and validated methods in determining ecological integrity; and (iv) adequate indicators to follow the evolution of the monitored ecosystems. While some countries increasingly use the establishment of marine parks to conserve marine biodiversity and ecological integrity, there is awareness (e.g. in Australia) that conservation and management of marine ecosystems cannot be restricted to Marine Protected Areas but must include areas outside such reserves. This contribution reviews the current situation of integrative ecological assessment worldwide, by presenting several examples from each of the continents: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America.},

This review synthesizes recent advances in the field around a framework for environmental assessment and management that can guide design of assessments, applications of phycology in assessments, and refinements of those applications to better support management decisions. Algae are critical parts of aquatic ecosystems that power food webs and biogeochemical cycling. Algae are also major sources of problems that threaten many ecosystems goods and services when abundances of nuisance and toxic taxa are high. Thus, algae can be used to indicate ecosystem goods and services, which complements how algal indicators are also used to assess levels of contaminants and habitat alterations (stressors). Understanding environmental managers' use of algal ecology, taxonomy, and physiology can guide our research and improve its application. Environmental assessments involve characterizing ecological condition and diagnosing causes and threats to ecosystems goods and services. Recent advances in characterizing condition include site-specific models that account for natural variability among habitats to better estimate effects of humans. Relationships between algal assemblages and stressors caused by humans help diagnose stressors and establish targets for protection and restoration. Many algal responses to stressors have thresholds that are particularly important for developing stakeholder consensus for stressor management targets. Future research on the regional-scale resilience of algal assemblages, the ecosystem goods and services they provide, and methods for monitoring and forecasting change will improve water resource management.},

   abstract = {In the Korean Peninsula's southern estuaries, the distributive characteristics of epilithic diatoms and the important environmental factors predicting species occurrence were examined. The collection of diatoms and measurements of water quality and land-use were performed every May between 2009 and 2016, with no influence from the Asian monsoon and snow. Throughout the study, 564 diatoms were classified with first and second dominant species of Nitzschia inconspicua and N. perminuta. Based on diatom appearance and standing crops, the 512 sampling stations were divided into four groups by cluster analysis, and two regions, namely the West and East Sea. Geographically, G1, G2, G3, and G4 were located in the East Sea, Southeast Sea, West Sea, and Southwest Sea, respectively. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) results indicated that environmental factors, such as turbidity, electric conductivity (EC), and total phosphorus (TP), significantly influenced the distribution of epilithic diatoms. A random forest model showed that major environmental factors influencing the diatom species appearance included EC, salinity, turbidity, and total nitrogen. This study demonstrated that the spatial distribution of epilithic diatoms in the southern estuaries of the Korean Peninsula was determined by several factors, including a geographically higher tidal current-driven turbidity increase and higher industrial or anthropogenic nutrient-loading.},

   abstract = {The promise of DNA barcoding is based on a small DNA fragment divergence coinciding with biological species separation. Here we evaluated the performance of three markers as diatom barcodes, the small ribosomal subunit (1600 bp), a 5' end fragment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (430 bp), and the second internal transcribed spacer region combined with the 5.8S gene (5.8S + ITS-2, 300-400 bp). Forty-four sequences per marker representing 28 species from all diatom classes were analysed. Sequence alignment of the three genetic markers and uncorrected genetic distances (P) were calculated at the intra- and heterospecific level. All three markers correctly separated the species examined and had advantages which contribute to their feasibility as a DNA barcode. Small ribosomal subunit had the largest GenBank data set, its success rate in amplification and sequencing was assumed to be the highest of all three and was readily aligned. However, it required a long fragment to recover divergence sufficient for species separation and small genetic distances increased the potential for misidentifications. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 demonstrated a substantial heterospecific divergence level and was also readily alignable, but it showed very low amplification and sequencing success rates with currently existing primers. 5.8S + ITS-2 was amplified and sequenced with high success rate and was the most variable of the three markers, but its secondary structure was needed to aid in alignment. However, since it has been recently suggested that ITS-2 may provide insight into sexual compatibility, this marker offers an additional advantage. We therefore propose that the 5.8S + ITS-2 fragment is the best candidate as a diatom DNA barcode.},

   abstract = {Analyzing the presence and quantifying trace elements is of paramount importance to understand natural environmental processes and monitor the degree of anthropogenic disturbance to mitigate impacts already caused. Here, we aimed to establish a baseline of the trace elements profile and concentrations in sandy sediments of intertidal areas of three Amazonian beaches (Brazil). For each beach, sediments were collected from three different sectors (south, center, and north) and five shoreline distance levels (from the high- to the low-water mark), totalizing 15 samples per beach. The concentration of the different trace elements (Mg, Al, P, S, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Cd, Sn, I, Hg, and Pb) was determined by Total reflection X-ray Fluorescence spectrometry. Sediment was also characterized for its grain size, organic matter, and pH. To assess possible enrichment due to anthropogenic activities we compared trace element levels with the values for the Earth’s crust and calculated pollution indexes: geoaccumulation index (Igeo), ecological risk index (RI), contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), and sediment quality guideline (SQG), threshold effects level (TEL) and probable effects level (PEL). Individual trace metal concentrations did not vary significantly between beaches, sectors, or sample levels, evidencing a homogeneity of trace elements composition and concentrations across this environment. Igeo indicated 62.2% of the sampling stations uncontaminated, 20.0% from uncontaminated to moderately contaminated, and 4.44% (two sampling stations) strongly contaminated, the same two areas classified as high ecological risk by RI. Most of the sampling points presented low CF. Cadmium and Hg were the only elements that showed moderate to very high values of CF. According to the SQGs, 77.7 and 8.8% of the sampling points presented values above the moderate threshold effect level (SQG-TEL) and probable effect level (SQG-PEL), respectively. All points were classified as non-polluted according to the PLI. Our results show that the three beaches present safe levels of almost of the elements demonstrating the good state of preservation. Most of the indexes classified the sampling points as non-polluted, except for Cd and Hg in a few specific sampling points.},

We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change.},

   abstract = {Abstract Grain size analysis is an essential tool for classifying sedimentary environments. The calculation of statistics for many samples can, however, be a laborious process. A computer program called GRADISTAT has been written for the rapid analysis of grain size statistics from any of the standard measuring techniques, such as sieving and laser granulometry. Mean, mode, sorting, skewness and other statistics are calculated arithmetically and geometrically (in metric units) and logarithmically (in phi units) using moment and Folk and Ward graphical methods. Method comparison has allowed Folk and Ward descriptive terms to be assigned to moments statistics. Results indicate that Folk and Ward measures, expressed in metric units, appear to provide the most robust basis for routine comparisons of compositionally variable sediments. The program runs within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet package and is extremely versatile, accepting standard and non-standard size data, and producing a range of graphical outputs including frequency and ternary plots.

   abstract = {The main goal of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to achieve good ecological status across European surface waters by 2015 and as such, it offers the opportunity and thus the challenge to improve the protection of our coastal systems. It is the main example for Europe's increasing desire to conserve aquatic ecosystems. Ironically, since c. 1975 the increasing adoption of EU directives has been accompanied by a decreasing interest of, for example, the Dutch government to assess the quality of its coastal and marine ecosystems. The surveillance and monitoring started in NL in 1971 has declined since the 1980s resulting in a 35% reduction of sampling stations. Given this and interruptions the remaining data series is considered to be insufficient for purposes other than trend analysis and compliance. The Dutch marine managers have apparently chosen a minimal (cost-effective) approach despite the WFD implicitly requiring the incorporation of the system's 'ecological complexity' in indices used to evaluate the ecological status of highly variable systems such as transitional and coastal waters. These indices should include both the community structure and system functioning and to make this really cost-effective a new monitoring strategy is required with a tailor-made programme. Since the adoption of the WFD in 2000 and the launching of the European Marine Strategy in 2002 (and the recently proposed Marine Framework Directive) we suggest reviewing national monitoring programmes in order to integrate water quality monitoring and biological monitoring and change from 'station oriented monitoring' to 'basin or system oriented monitoring' in combination with specific 'cause-effect' studies for highly dynamic coastal systems. Progress will be made if the collected information is integrated and aggregated in valuable tools such as structure- and functioning-oriented computer simulation models and Decision Support Systems. The development of ecological indices integrating community structure and system functioning, such as in Ecological Network Analysis, are proposed to meet a cost-effective approach at the national level and full assessment of the ecosystem status at the EU level. The WFD offers the opportunity to re-consider and re-invest in environmental research and monitoring. Using examples from the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom, the present paper therefore reviews marine monitoring and marine environmental research in combination and in the light of such major policy initiatives such as the WFD.},

We propose a new method for early warning signals that integrates multiple sources of information and data about the system through the framework of a generalized model. We demonstrate our proposed approach through several examples, including a previously published fisheries model. We regard our method as complementary to existing early warning signals, taking an approach of intermediate complexity between model-free approaches and fully parameterized simulations. One potential advantage of our approach is that, under appropriate conditions, it may reduce the amount of time series data required for a robust early warning signal.},

   abstract = {Spatial and interannual variations of phytoplankton diversity were characterized along the French Atlantic Coast in relation to physical factors and large-scale climatic indices using phytoplankton surveys conducted from 1993 to 2010 in four geographical areas. This study relates phytoplankton diversity to oyster recruitment success by comparing a ‘specific’ versus a ‘functional’ diversity approach. Functional diversity was represented by functional groups of different phytoplanktonic functional traits (size, shape, toxicity), relevant for oyster feeding during growth, reproduction and larval development. Phytoplankton diversity patterns along the French Atlantic coast corresponded to a geographical distribution mainly driven by a latitudinal gradient and hydrodynamic features as confirmed by the functional characteristics of the indicator species recorded for each geographical area (C-S-R strategies of Reynolds, specific habitat). This geographical typology was less clear for functional diversity. Only few functional groups were explained by physical factors: the non-toxic small and solitary cells were in particular related to temperature, with high densities observed in the southern areas. Even if temporal variation was less important in explaining the phytoplankton diversity patterns, the main drivers explaining the interannual pattern were the large-scale climatic indices, mainly the Atlantic Multidecennal Oscillation. Functional groups were readily explained by climatic indices than species even if the relationships cannot be applied generally because of the non-linearity of the correlations (local and temporal variations). However, the potentially toxic, small and linear phytoplankton were anticorrelated to NAO. The functional approach thus brings constructive elements concerning the relationships between the prey assemblage of oysters and their physical drivers. Redundancy and co-inertia analyses appeared as complementary analyses in investigating phytoplankton pattern of variation, being particularly useful in analyzing geographical and temporal diversity fluctuation, respectively.},

   abstract = {Diatoms (Bacillariophyta) are ubiquitous microalgae which produce a siliceous exoskeleton and which make a major contribution to the productivity of oceans and freshwaters. They display a huge diversity, which makes them excellent ecological indicators of aquatic ecosystems. Usually, diatoms are identified using characteristics of their exoskeleton morphology. DNA-barcoding is an alternative to this and the use of High-Throughput-Sequencing enables the rapid analysis of many environmental samples at a lower cost than analyses under microscope. However, to identify environmental sequences correctly, an expertly curated reference library is needed. Several curated libraries for protists exists; none, however are dedicated to diatoms. Diat.barcode is an open-access library dedicated to diatoms which has been maintained since 2012. Data come from two sources (1) the NCBI nucleotide database and (2) unpublished sequencing data of culture collections. Since 2017, several experts have collaborated to curate this library for rbcL, a chloroplast marker suitable for species-level identification of diatoms. For the latest version of the database (version 7), 605 of the 3482 taxonomical names originally assigned by the authors of the rbcL sequences were modified after curation. The database is accessible at https://www6.inra.fr/carrtel-collection_eng/Barcoding-database .},

Here, 16 countries do not have dedicated phytobenthos methods, some include filamentous algae within macrophyte survey methods whilst others use diatoms as proxies for phytobenthos. The most widely-cited justification for not having a dedicated phytobenthos method is redundancy, i.e. that macrophyte and phytoplankton assessments alone are sufficient to detect nutrient impacts. Evidence from those European Union Member States that have dedicated phytobenthos methods supports this for high level overviews of lake condition and classification; however, there are a number of situations where phytobenthos may contribute valuable information for the management of lakes.},

Sampling was carried out for 4 days in August and September. Flood-tide water carried significantly higher amounts of Chl. a from the mudflat transition zone onto the salt marsh compared to the amount of leaving the salt marsh during ebb tides. Suspended solid loads, suspended Chl. a concentrations, and diatom species composition provided evidence that resuspended mudflat sediments containing biofilm material were transferred onto the salt marsh by flood tide. Significant negative correlations between sediment Chl. a concentrations on the upper mudflat transition zone and Chl. a concentrations in flood-tide water indicated biostabilization of sediments by biofilms reducing sediment resuspension. Mean wind speed had a significant positive effect on resuspending Chl. a from the salt marsh sediment surface into the ebb tide (p < 0.001). The amount of Chl. a being resuspended in flood and ebb tidal waters was significantly correlated with MPB biomass on the sediment surface on the mudflat and salt marsh, respectively. Resuspended diatoms over the mudflat during high tide shared a total of 54.3% similar species with diatoms recorded in flood tidal water over the salt marsh. Diatom taxa characteristic of salt marsh assemblages, and some deposited diatom taxa were resuspended and carried off the salt marsh during ebb tide. Resuspension of Chl. a in both flood and ebb waters was significantly controlled by the tidal range (both significant at p < 0.001).

   abstract = {Soil micro-organisms drive the global carbon and nutrient cycles that underlie essential ecosystem functions. Yet, we are only beginning to grasp the drivers of terrestrial microbial diversity and biogeography, which presents a substantial barrier to understanding community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. This is especially true for soil protists, which despite their functional significance have received comparatively less interest than their bacterial counterparts. Here, we investigate the diversification of Pinnularia borealis, a rare biosphere soil diatom species complex, using a global sampling of >800 strains. We document unprecedented high levels of species-diversity, reflecting a global radiation since the Eocene/Oligocene global cooling. Our analyses suggest diversification was largely driven by colonization of novel geographic areas and subsequent evolution in isolation. These results illuminate our understanding of how protist diversity, biogeographical patterns, and members of the rare biosphere are generated, and suggest allopatric speciation to be a powerful mechanism for diversification of micro-organisms.},

   abstract = {The basic requirements for diatom analysis have changed little over the last few decades in terms of sampling, slide preparation, microscopy and taxonomy but, on the other hand, there have been major improvements in our knowledge of diatom distribution and ecology and a revolution in our ability to analyse diatom data. These changes have been driven by the increasing recognition of the practical uses of diatoms as indicators of environmental change and by the development of novel numerical and computing techniques that allow diatom-environment relationships to be quantified. However, in the future and despite the application of new techniques (e.g., Vasko et al., 2000), it is unlikely that there will be significant improvements in transfer function statistics or in the range of environmental variables for which diatoms can be confidently used. Nevertheless, there is real scope for making transfer functions much more widely applicable around the world principally through web-based information systems such as EDDI (Battarbee et al., 2000), and in using the databases generated through merged training sets to explore unresolved and vastly under-researched questions of diatom biogeography. In addition, as multi-proxy approaches in palaeolimnology become common, diatomists should be able to focus more on questions of ecological response to environmental change rather than on reconstructing environmental change per se. Such a move would be especially welcome as it would herald a change from purely empirical mechanistic approaches inherent in the transfer function method to approaches that require a deeper understanding of diatom habitats, life-cycles and competitive strategies and a wider consideration of the role of diatoms in the overall functioning of aquatic ecosystems},

   abstract = {We examined gametogenesis and auxospore development in the cymatosiroid diatom Brockmanniella brockmannii. Our mating experiments demonstrated that the clones were homothallic, self-compatible, produced two eggs per oogonium and four hologenous uniflagellate male gametes per spermatogonium. Auxospores grew free in the culture medium and the most external layer of the auxospore wall was made up of spinescent scaly elements in their early globular stage of development. The anisodiametric expansion of the globular auxospore was rather limited, at best proceeding only to a sub-globular stage. Our data suggest that the initial epivalves, nearly pennate-like in outline, developed within such auxospores curled up against the ventral side of the auxospore wall, not across its equatorial plane, and apparently without the help of rings, hoops or bands characteristic of pennate-type transverse perizonia. Thus, B. brockmannii showed a mode of initial epivalve development thus far unknown among diatoms. We propose that progressive silicification of the initial epivalve facilitated the breakdown of the sub-globular auxospore dorsal wall to accommodate for its straightening. The structural features of the spinescent scales on the auxospore wall suggest that Cymatosiraceae could be related to the mediophycean family Eupodiscaceae, although most current molecular phylogenies do not support a direct relationship.},

   abstract = {While different microalgae tend to be associated with different bacteria, it remains unclear whether such specific associations are beneficial for the microalgae. We assessed the impact of bacterial isolates, derived from various marine benthic diatoms, on the growth of several strains belonging to the Cylindrotheca closterium diatom species complex. We first tested the effect of 35 different bacterial isolates on the growth of a single C. closterium strain, and then evaluated the impact of 8 of these isolates on the growth of 6 C. closterium strains and 1 Cylindrotheca fusiformis strain. Surprisingly, most interactions were neutral to antagonistic. The interactions were highly specific, with diatom growth in the presence of specific bacteria differing between Cylindrotheca strains and species, and closely related bacteria eliciting contrasting diatom growth responses. These differences could be related to the origin of the bacterial isolates, as only isolates from foreign diatom hosts significantly reduced diatom growth, implying coadaptation between different Cylindrotheca strains and their associated bacteria. Interestingly, the antagonistic effect of a Marinobacter strain was alleviated by the presence of a microbial inoculum that was native to the diatom host, suggesting that coadapted bacteria might also benefit their host indirectly by preventing the establishment of harmful bacteria.},

With the use of spatial databases, GIS, and available information about the value of rocky-shore communities as indicators of water quality, it is possible to obtain an environmental quality index representative of the ecological status of rocky coasts. This index, which completely fulfils the requirements of the WFD, is expressed as a ratio between the observed values in the sector of shore that is being assessed and the expected value in a reference condition zone with the same substrate and coastal morphology (Ecological Quality Ratio, EQR).

   abstract = {The rise of human populations and the growth of cities contribute to the depletion of natural resources, increase their cost, and create potential climatic changes. To overcome difficulties in supplying populations and reducing the resource cost, a search for alternative pharmaceutical, nanotechnology, and energy sources has begun. Among the alternative sources, microalgae are the most promising because they use carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce biomass and/or valuable compounds. Once produced, the biomass is ordinarily harvested and processed (downstream program). Drying, grinding, and extraction steps are destructive to the microalgal biomass that then needs to be renewed. The extraction and purification processes generate organic wastes and require substantial energy inputs. Altogether, it is urgent to develop alternative downstream processes. Among the possibilities, milking invokes the concept that the extraction should not kill the algal cells. Therefore, it does not require growing the algae anew. In this review, we discuss research on milking of diatoms. The main themes are (a) development of alternative methods to extract and harvest high added value compounds; (b) design of photobioreactors;},

   abstract = {Seaweed and seagrass communities in the northeast Atlantic have been profoundly impacted by humans, and the rate of change is accelerating rapidly due to runaway CO2 emissions and mounting pressures on coastlines associated with human population growth and increased consumption of finite resources. Here, we predict how rapid warming and acidification are likely to affect benthic flora and coastal ecosystems of the northeast Atlantic in this century, based on global evidence from the literature as interpreted by the collective knowledge of the authorship. We predict that warming will kill off kelp forests in the south and that ocean acidification will remove maerl habitat in the north. Seagrasses will proliferate, and associated epiphytes switch from calcified algae to diatoms and filamentous species. Invasive species will thrive in niches liberated by loss of native species and spread via exponential development of artificial marine structures. Combined impacts of seawater warming, ocean acidification, and increased storminess may replace structurally diverse seaweed canopies, with associated calcified and noncalcified flora, with simple habitats dominated by noncalcified, turf-forming seaweeds.},

   abstract = {Current approaches to ecological assessment are limited by the traditional morpho-taxonomic methods presently employed and the inability to meet increasing demands for rapid assessments. Advancements in high throughput sequencing now enable rapid high-resolution ecological assessment using environmental DNA (eDNA). Here we test the ability of using eDNA-based ecological assessment methods against traditional assessment of two key indicator groups (diatoms and macroinvertebrates) and show how eDNA across multiple gene regions (COI, rbcL, 12S and 18S) can be used to infer interactive networks that link to ecological assessment criteria. We compared results between taxonomic and eDNA based assessments and found significant positive associations between macroinvertebrate (p < 0.001 R(2) = 0.645) and diatom (p = 0.015, R(2) = 0.222) assessment metrics. We further assessed the ability of eDNA based assessment to identify environmentally sensitive genera and found an order of magnitude greater potential for 18S, versus COI or rbcL, to determine environmental filtering of ecologically assessed communities. Lastly, we compared the ability of traditional metrics against co-occurrence network properties of our combined 18S, COI and rbcL indicator genera to infer habitat quality measures currently used by managers. We found that transitivity (network connectivity), linkage density and cohesion were significantly associated with habitat modification scores (HMS), whereas network properties were inconsistent with linking to the habitat quality score (HQS) metric. The incorporation of multi-marker eDNA network assessment opens up a means for finer scale ecological assessment, currently limited using traditional methods. While utilization of eDNA-based assessment is recommended, direct comparisons with traditional approaches are difficult as the methods are intrinsically different and should be treated as such with regards to future research. Overall, our findings show that eDNA can be used for effective ecological assessment while offering a wider range of scope and application compared to traditional assessment methods.},

   abstract = {Phytoplankton is the main indicator group for eutrophication in coastal ecosystems, however its high dispersal potential does not enable the assessment of localized effects of coastal nutrient enrichment. Benthic diatoms are sessile microalgae associated with sandy substrates and have the potential to reflect more localized pollution impacts. Although benthic diatoms are widely used bioindicators in freshwater systems, they have rarely been used for assessing the eutrophication status of oligotrophic environments such as the eastern Mediterranean Sea. In the present study, we assess the efficiency of benthic diatoms as bioindicators of nutrient enrichment in oligotrophic coastal systems, by investigating the effect of different physicochemical conditions and nutrient concentrations on the assemblage composition, diversity and individual species populations. To do this, we sampled along a eutrophication gradient formed by anthropogenic nutrient inputs from a metropolitan area. The main driver of assemblage composition, diversity and biomass of diatoms was nitrogen concentration and its temporal and spatial changes. Nitrogen loadings were positively correlated with increased biomass of Cocconeis spp. and negatively correlated with Mastogloia spp. Our findings suggest that in coastal ecosystems of oligotrophic marine ecoregions, benthic diatom assemblage structure and specific taxonomic groups can be reliable predictors of coastal eutrophication offering higher spatial resolution compared to phytoplankton.},

   abstract = {Slab photonic crystals (PhCs) are photonic structures used in many modern optical technologies. Fabrication of these components is costly and usually involves eco-unfriendly methods, requiring modern nanofabrication techniques and cleanroom facilities. This work describes that diatom microalgae evolved elaborate and highly reproducible slab PhCs in the girdle, a part of their silicon dioxide exoskeletons. Under natural conditions in water, the girdle of the centric diatom Coscinodiscus granii shows a well-defined optical pseudogap for modes in the near-infrared (NIR). This pseudogap shows dispersion toward the visible spectral range when light is incident at larger angles, eventually facilitating in-plane propagation for modes in the green spectral range. The optical features can be modulated with refractive index contrast. The unit cell period, a critical factor controlling the pseudogap, is highly preserved within individuals of a long-term cultivated inbred line and between at least four different C. granii cell culture strains tested in this study. Other diatoms present similar unit cell morphologies with various periods. Diatoms thereby offer a wide range of PhC structures, reproducible and equipped with well-defined properties, possibly covering the entire UV-vis-NIR spectral range. Diatoms therefore offer an alternative as cost-effective and environmentally friendly produced photonic materials.},

Our experiment with the bivalves Macomona liliana and Austrovenus stutchburyi on marine sandflats in New Zealand demonstrated that reductions in incident sunlight changed the interaction network between sediment biogeochemical fluxes, productivity, and macrofauna. By demonstrating loss of positive feedbacks and changes in the architecture of the network, we provide mechanistic evidence that stressors lead to break points in dynamics, which theory predicts predispose a system to a critical transition.},

   abstract = {The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is now well established as the key management imperative in river basins across Europe. However, there remain significant concerns with the way WFD is implemented and there is now a need for water managers and scientists to communicate better in order to find solutions to these concerns. To address this, a Science-Policy Interface (SPI) activity was launched in 2010 led by Directorate-General for Research and Innovation and Onema (the French national agency for water and aquatic ecosystems), which provided an interactive forum to connect scientists and WFD end-users. One major aim of the SPI activity was to establish a list of the most crucial research and development needs for enhancing WFD implementation. This paper synthesises the recommendations from this event highlighting 10 priority issues relating to ecological status. For lakes, temporary streams and transitional and coastal waters, WFD implementation still suffers from a lack of WFD-compliant bioassessment methods. For rivers, special attention is required to assess the ecological impacts of hydromorphological alterations on biological communities, notably those affecting river continuity and riparian covering. Spatial extrapolation tools are needed in order to evaluate ecological status for water bodies for which no data are available. The need for more functional bioassessment tools as complements to usual WFD-compliant tools, and to connect clearly good ecological state, biodiversity and ecosystem services when implementing WFD were also identified as crucial issues.},

   abstract = {The Loire estuary has been surveyed from 1982 to 1985 by 13 isochronous longitudinal profiles realized at low tide. Nutrient (SiO2, NO3−, NH4+, PO3−4, particulate organic carbon or POC) patterns are very variable depending on the season, the estuarine section [river, upper-inner estuary, upstream of the fresh-water-saline-water interphase FSI, the lower-inner estuary characterized by the high turbidity zone (HTZ), the outer estuary] and the river discharge. Biological processes are dominant. In the eutrophied River Loire (summer pigment > 100 μg l−1), the high algal productivity (algal POC > 3 mg l−1) results in severe depletion of SiO2, PO43−, NO3−. The enormous biomass (55 000 ton algal POC/year) is degraded in the HTZ where bacterial activity is intense. As a result, there is generally a regeneration of dissolved SiO2 and PO43−, a marked NH4+ maximum, while NO3− is conservative or depleted when the HTZ is nearly anoxic. Other processes can be considered including pollution from fertilizer plans (PO43−, NH4+) and from a hydrothermal power plant (NH4+). In the less turbid outer estuary, nutrients are generally conservative. Major variations of concentrations are observed in the lowest chlorinity section (Cl− < 1 g kg−) and also upstream the FSI, defined here as a 100% increase in Cl−. Nutrient inputs to the ocean are not significantly modified for SiO2 and NO2−, but are increased by 70% and 180% for PO43− and NH4+ and depleted by 60% for POC. Odd hydrological events, especially some floods, may perturbate or even mask the usual seasonal pattern observed in profiles. Résumé L'estuaire de la Loire a été suivi de 1982 à 1985 par 13 profils longitudinaux synoptiques effectués marée basse. Les éléments nutritifs (SiO2, NO3−, NH4+, PO43−, carbone organique particulaire ou COP) présentent des profils très divers dans les sections étudiées (rivière, zone fluvio-estuarienne en amont du front de salinité, zone du bouchon vaseux, estuaire externe) qui dépendent de l'élément étudié, de la section, de la saison, et de l'hydrodynamique fluvio-estuarienne. Les processus biologiques semblent ici dominants. La rivière est très eutrophe (pigments > 100 μgl en été). Il en résulte un appauvrissement saisonnier marqué en SiO2, NO3−, PO43−, et une biomasse algale importante (COP > 3 mg l−). Cet apport (55000 t COP algal/an) est dégradé dans le bouchon vaseux, région d'activité bactérienne intense. Il en résulte, en général, un régénération de silice dissoute, de PO43− et un pic marqué en NH4+, alors que NO3− est conservatif ou en défaut par rapport aux dilutions théoriques. D'autres processus peuvent être invoqués, incluant une pollution par des usines d'engrais (PO43−, NH4+) et une usine hydroélectrique (NH4+). Dans l'estuaire externe, beaucoup moins turbide, les nutrients sont en général relativement conservatifs. Les principales variations de concentrations sont observées dans les zones de faibles chlorinités (Cl− < 1 g kg−1) et même en amont du front salin (défini ici comme le doublement des chlorures fluviaux). Les bilans d'apports à l'océan ne sont pas modifiés pour SiO2 et NO3− et sont majorés de 70% et 180% pour PO43− et NH4+ et minorés de 60% pour le COP. Des épisodes hydrologiques, surtout des crues, peuvent complètement perturber ou occulter les variations saisonnières observées dans les profils.},

   abstract = {Benthic diatom communities have been documented many times to exhibit a predictable pattern of migration entrained to diurnal and tidal cycles forming transient biofilms in the estuarine intertidal. The highly visible nature of these biofilms means that many anecdotal descriptions of this behaviour exist, yet much still remains to be elucidated about these behaviours and what drives them. There has been a resurgence in work examining the migratory patterns of benthic diatoms because of the important roles they play in the overall functioning of the ecosystem (e.g. primary production). It is the aim of this paper to provide a comprehensive overview of the migratory literature to date. The paper will review the methodology that was historically used to examine patterns in diatom migration as well as introduce new technologies (e.g. remote sensing). The patterns and cues for migration are discussed, highlighting the fact that whilst a "classic" pattern of migration is often found (migration of cells to the sediment surface as the tide leaves the site followed by a downwards migration in anticipation of the incoming tide), these cannot be considered to be consistent, with many site and taxon specific idiosyncrasies. Furthermore, it has been suggested that cells also migrate within the biofilm, cycling their position at the sediment surface therefore maximising their overall fitness, and this hypothesis is discussed. The vertical migration strategy of the benthic diatoms is critical to their pivotal role in the structure and functioning of estuarine intertidal mudflats and the costs and benefits of a microphytobenthic existence are discussed in this context.},

We investigated the impact of a natural nematode assemblage on the biomass and microbial community structure of a multispecies diatom biofilm. Nematodes stimulated diatom biomass accumulation of the biofilm and caused a shift in diatom community structure. Higher diatom biomass accumulation in the presence of nematodes could be the result of increased diatom biomass production through nutrient regeneration resulting from grazing or bioturbation, and/or through shifts in interspecific interactions between diatoms (e.g. competition) through selective grazing. Alternatively, lower biomass in the controls may be due to higher secretion of diatom production in the form of bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Our observations underscore that meiobenthos, and especially nematodes, are important for the structure and production of tidal biofilms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two decades of research showing that increasing plant diversity results in greater community productivity has been predicated on greater functional diversity allowing access to more of the total available resources. Thus, understanding phenotypic attributes that allow species to partition resources is fundamentally important to explaining diversity-productivity relationships. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we use data from a long-term experiment (Cedar Creek, MN) and compare the extent to which productivity is explained by seven types of community metrics of functional variation: 1) species richness, 2) variation in 10 individual traits, 3) functional group richness, 4) a distance-based measure of functional diversity, 5) a hierarchical multivariate clustering method, 6) a nonmetric multidimensional scaling approach, and 7) a phylogenetic diversity measure, summing phylogenetic branch lengths connecting community members together and may be a surrogate for ecological differences. Although most of these diversity measures provided significant explanations of variation in productivity, the presence of a nitrogen fixer and phylogenetic diversity were the two best explanatory variables. Further, a statistical model that included the presence of a nitrogen fixer, seed weight and phylogenetic diversity was a better explanation of community productivity than other models. CONCLUSIONS: Evolutionary relationships among species appear to explain patterns of grassland productivity. Further, these results reveal that functional differences among species involve a complex suite of traits and that perhaps phylogenetic relationships provide a better measure of the diversity among species that contributes to productivity than individual or small groups of traits.},

To evaluate the applicability of DNA-based tools to ecological status assessment, we evaluated whether the results derived from presence/absence data are comparable to those derived from abundance data. We analysed benthic invertebrate community data obtained from 13,312 WFD assessments of German streams. Broken down to 30 official stream types, we compared assessment results based on abundance and presence/absence data for the assessment modules "organic pollution" (i.e., the saprobic index) and "general degradation" (a multimetric index) as well as their underlying metrics. In 76.6% of cases, the ecological status class did not change after transforming abundance data to presence/absence data. In 12% of cases, the status class was reduced by one (e.g., from good to moderate), and in 11.2% of cases, the class increased by one. In only 0.2% of cases, the status shifted by two classes. Systematic stream type-specific deviations were found and differences between abundance and presence/absence data were most prominent for stream types where abundance information contributed directly to one or several metrics of the general degradation module. For a single stream type, these deviations led to a systematic shift in status from 'good' to 'moderate' (n = 201; with only n = 3 increasing). The systematic decrease in scores was observed, even when considering simulated confidence intervals for abundance data. Our analysis suggests that presence/absence data can yield similar assessment results to those for abundance-based data, despite type-specific deviations. For most metrics, it should be possible to intercalibrate the two data types without substantial efforts. Thus, benthic invertebrate taxon lists generated by standardised DNA-based methods should be further considered as a complementary approach.},

   abstract = {The present study aims at evaluating the impact of diatoms and copepods on microbial processes mediating nitrate removal in fine-grained intertidal sediments. More specifically, we studied the interactions between copepods, diatoms and bacteria in relation to their effects on nitrate reduction and denitrification. Microcosms containing defaunated marine sediments were subjected to different treatments: an excess of nitrate, copepods, diatoms (Navicula sp.), a combination of copepods and diatoms, and spent medium from copepods. The microcosms were incubated for seven and a half days, after which nutrient concentrations and denitrification potential were measured. Ammonium concentrations were highest in the treatments with copepods or their spent medium, whilst denitrification potential was lowest in these treatments, suggesting that copepods enhance dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium over denitrification. We hypothesize that this is an indirect effect, by providing extra carbon for the bacterial community through the copepods' excretion products, thus changing the C/N ratio in favour of dissimilatory nitrate reduction. Diatoms alone had no effect on the nitrogen fluxes, but they did enhance the effect of copepods, possibly by influencing the quantity and quality of the copepods' excretion products. Our results show that small-scale biological interactions between bacteria, copepods and diatoms can have an important impact on denitrification and hence sediment nitrogen fluxes.},

   abstract = {High concentrations of microplastics have been found in sea ice but the mechanisms by which they get captured into the ice and which role ice algae might play in this process remain unknown. Similarly, we do not know how the presence of microplastics might impact the colonization of sea ice by ice algae. To estimate the ecological impact of microplastics for Polar ecosystems, it is essential to understand their behaviour during ice formation and possible interactions with organisms inhabiting sea ice. In this study we tested the interaction between the ice algae Fragillariopsis cylindrus and microplastic beads with and without sea ice present and, in a third experiment, during the process of ice formation. With sea ice present, we found significantly less algae cells in the ice when incubated together with microplastics compared to the incubation without microplastics. However, during ice formation, the presence of microplastics did not impact the colonisation of the ice by F. cylindrus cells. Further, we observed a strong correlation between salinity and the relative amount of beads in the water and ice. With increasing salinity of the water, the relative amount of beads in the water decreased significantly. At the same time, the relative amount of beads in the ice increased significantly with increasing ice salinity. Both processes were not influenced by the presence of F. cylindrus. Also, we found indications that the presence of algae can affect the amount of microplastic beads sticking to the container walls. This could indicate that EPS produced by ice algae plays a significant role in surface binding properties of microplastics. Overall, our results highlight that the interactions between algae and microplastics have an influence on the uptake of microplastics into sea ice with possible implications for the sea ice food web.},

   abstract = {Chronic, non-lethal stressors occurring gradually (in space or time) can result in cumulative impacts that are more dramatic than higher intensities or occasional critical levels of any single one of these stressors. The negative effects of the chronic stressors trigger lasting impacts that may grow in intensity and become problematic over time and/or to higher trophic levels. In rivers, aquatic organisms experience this type of cumulative stress along the up- to downstream gradient in natural and anthropogenic contaminants generally observed in inhabited watersheds. Diatoms are a major component of the periphyton in rivers; their richness and diversity in natural communities are directly related to their varied ecological preferences and sensitivity to disturbance. In this study, we monitored from 2003 to 2008 the changes in the diversity of taxonomic and non-taxonomic features along a small river (Riou-Mort, South West France), at three sites: one site upstream considered as a reference for this watershed, one intermediate site with high nutrient load, and one downstream site exposed to both nutrient and metal pollution. The cumulative impacts of nutrients plus metals led to a gradual decrease in species richness and diversity, and in a potential capacity to cope with additional stresses, e.g., climate change-related ones. This is reflected by a decrease in species richness downstream, more dramatic in the hot summer of 2003 than in cooler summers. With the increasingly protective environmental regulations (e.g., Water Framework Directive in Europe), accumulation of stresses on aquatic resources are recommended to receive increasing attention, in particular considering the expected changes in climate.},

   abstract = {Benthic diatoms are the main primary producers in shallow freshwater and coastal environments, fulfilling important ecological functions such as nutrient cycling and sediment stabilization. However, little is known about their evolutionary adaptations to these highly structured but heterogeneous environments. Here, we report a reference genome for the marine biofilm-forming diatom Seminavis robusta, showing that gene family expansions are responsible for a quarter of all 36,254 protein-coding genes. Tandem duplications play a key role in extending the repertoire of specific gene functions, including light and oxygen sensing, which are probably central for its adaptation to benthic habitats. Genes differentially expressed during interactions with bacteria are strongly conserved in other benthic diatoms while many species-specific genes are strongly upregulated during sexual reproduction. Combined with re-sequencing data from 48 strains, our results offer insights into the genetic diversity and gene functions in benthic diatoms.},

Yet, most species remain unknown or unstudied, while others attract most of the public, scientific and government attention. Although known to be detrimental, this taxonomic bias continues to be pervasive in the scientific literature, but is still poorly studied and understood. Here, we used 626 million occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the biggest biodiversity data portal, to characterize the taxonomic bias in biodiversity data. We also investigated how societal preferences and taxonomic research relate to biodiversity data gathering. For each species belonging to 24 taxonomic classes, we used the number of publications from Web of Science and the number of web pages from Bing searches to approximate research activity and societal preferences. Our results show that societal preferences, rather than research activity, strongly correlate with taxonomic bias, which lead us to assert that scientists should advertise less charismatic species and develop societal initiatives (e.g. citizen science) that specifically target neglected organisms. Ensuring that biodiversity is representatively sampled while this is still possible is an urgent prerequisite for achieving efficient conservation plans and a global understanding of our surrounding environment.},

More than 216 taxa were observed, revealing a rich circumpolar diatom flora, including many undescribed taxa. Widely distributed taxa were the most abundant by cell densities, while circumpolar taxa were the most species rich. Stream and pond habitats hosted different assemblages, and varied along a pH gradient. Diatoma tenuis was the most abundant and ubiquitous taxon. However, several circumpolar taxa such as Chamaepinnularia gandrupii, Cymbella botellus, Psammothidium sp. and Humidophila laevissima were also found in relatively high abundances. Aerophilic taxa were an important component of FJL diatom assemblages (Humidophila spp., Caloneis spp. and Pinnularia spp.), reflecting the large and extreme seasonal changes in Arctic conditions. We predict a decrease in the abundance of circumpolar taxa, an increase in local (alpha-) freshwater diatom diversity, but a decrease in regional diversity (circumpolar homogenization) as a result of current warming trends and to a lesser extent the increasing human footprint in the region.},

   abstract = {The validity of categorizing the diatoms and dinoflagellates reported in the literature as non-indigenous phytoplankton in the European Seas was investigated. Species that are synonymous are often included as separate species (Gessnerium mochimaensis=Alexandrium monilatum, Gymnodinium nagasakiense=Karenia mikimotoi, Pleurosigma simonsenii=P. planctonicum), while other species names are synonyms of cosmopolitan taxa (Prorocentrum redfieldii=P. triestinum, Pseliodinium vaubanii=Gyrodinium falcatum, Gonyaulax grindleyi=Protoceratium reticulatum, Asterionella japonica=Asterionellopsis glacialis). Epithets of an exotic etymology (i.e. japonica, sinensis, indica) imply that a cosmopolitan species may be non-indigenous, and several taxa are even considered as non-indigenous in their type locality (Alexandrium tamarense and A. pseudogoniaulax). The records of Alexandrium monilatum, A. leei and Corethron criophilum are doubtful. Cold or warm-water species expand their geographical ranges or increase their abundances to detectable levels during cooling (Coscinodiscus wailesii) or warming periods (Chaetoceros coarctatus, Proboscia indica, Pyrodinium bahamense). These are a few examples of marginal dispersal associated with climatic events instead of species introductions from remote areas. The number of non-indigenous phytoplankton species in European Seas has thus been excessively inflated.},

   abstract = {A set of equations for determining chlorophyll a (Chl a) and accessory chlorophylls b, c2, c1 + c2 and the special case of Acaryochloris marina, which uses Chl d as its primary photosynthetic pigment and also has Chl a, have been developed for 90% acetone, methanol and ethanol solvents. These equations for different solvents give chlorophyll assays that are consistent with each other. No algorithms for Chl c compounds (c2, c1 + c2) in the presence of Chl a have previously been published for methanol or ethanol. The limits of detection (and inherent error, +/- 95% confidence limit), for chlorophylls in all organisms tested, was generally less than 0.1 microg/ml. The Chl a and b algorithms for green algae and land plants have very small inherent errors (< 0.01 microg/ml). Chl a and d algorithms for Acaryochloris marina are consistent with each other, giving estimates of Chl d/a ratios which are consistent with previously published estimates using HPLC and a rarely used algorithm originally published for diethyl ether in 1955. The statistical error structure of chlorophyll algorithms is discussed. The relative error of measurements of chlorophylls increases hyperbolically in diluted chlorophyll extracts because the inherent errors of the chlorophyll algorithms are constants independent of the magnitude of absorbance readings. For safety reasons, efficient extraction of chlorophylls and the convenience of being able to use polystyrene cuvettes, the algorithms for ethanol are recommended for routine assays of chlorophylls. The methanol algorithms would be convenient for assays associated with HPLC work.},

   abstract = {A factorial experiment was carried out in order to assess the effects of four treatment steps in diatom processing techniques (the quantity of hydrogen peroxide added to the sample, the time allowed to the digestion reaction, the use of centrifugation and the method used to settle the frustules onto the coverslip) on different aspects of the quality of the resulting microscopic slide: the concentration of organic and inorganic matter, the density, randomness and homogeneity of the frustule distribution in the slide, and the abundance of broken frustules and girdle views. The results show no significant effects of any of the experimental treatments on the proportion of broken frustules in the samples. No significant effects were related to the duration of the oxidation reaction in any of the aspects evaluated in the quality of the slides. A sample:hydrogen peroxide ratio of 1:1 for a 6-h oxidizing reaction can be used to optimize the protocol. Despite being more time consuming, the use of successive decantations instead of centrifuging is more appropriate to achieve better results. Slide quality can also be improved by leaving the coverslips to dry at room temperature in order to improve the distribution of frustules.},

Microbial mats can develop on street surfaces and form microbial communities that have never been described. Here, we performed the first molecular inventory of the street gutter-associated eukaryotes across the entire French capital of Paris and the non-potable waters sources. We found that the 5782 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) present in the street gutters which are dominated by diatoms (photoautotrophs), fungi (heterotrophs), Alveolata and Rhizaria, includes parasites, consumers of phototrophs and epibionts that may regulate the dynamics of gutter mat microbial communities. Network analyses demonstrated that street microbiome present many species restricted to gutters, and an overlapping composition between the water sources used for street cleaning (for example, intra-urban aquatic networks and the associated rivers) and the gutters. We propose that street gutters, which can cover a significant surface area of cities worldwide, potentially have important ecological roles in the remediation of pollutants or downstream wastewater treatments, might also be a niche for growth and dissemination of putative parasite and pathogens.},

   abstract = {Abstract Good estimates of pollutant fluxes are required for Earth systems sciences and water quality management. The gradual accumulation of water quality data records over the past few decades has increased the value of these data for examining long-term trends. On many major rivers, however, infrequent sampling of most pollutants makes flux estimates and their analysis difficult. This paper explores the performance of different methods for estimating nutrient fluxes. The objective is to assess the accuracy (bias) and precision (dispersion) of annual nutrient fluxes based on monthly sampling, which is the frequency with which 80% of French water quality surveys have been carried out since 1971. The study is based on a data set of nutrient concentrations surveyed at high frequency during a 5 year pilot study (1981–85) at the Orléans station in the middle reaches of the River Loire, France. The mean specific fluxes were 641 (nitrate-N), 96 (total-P) and 37 kg year−1 km−2 (orthophosphate-P). For each year, the data set was then ‘resampled’ by randomly simulating 12 sampling dates. 100 simulated monthly samplings were generated, upon which seven estimation methods were tested. The evaluations indicate that, when concentrations of specific substances in large rivers exhibit seasonal variation, a simple method based on linear interpolation between samples taken at approximately monthly intervals is advocated. With the monthly sampling interval, the precision (confidence level of 95%) of annual nutrient fluxes obtained by the appropriate methods was 13% for nitrates, 20% for total-P, 26% for orthophosphates, and 34% for particulate-P. The frequency of water quality surveys required to obtain an annual nutrient flux with 10% precision was around 15 days for nitrate, 10 days for orthophosphate-P and total-P, and about 5 days in the case of particulate-P.

   abstract = {A study of the particulate organic carbon (POC) in the estuarine turbidity maxima (ETMs) of the three major French macrotidal estuaries shows that the average contents are 1.5, 3.3 and 3.1% (expressed in % of dry suspended sediment) in the Gironde, Loire and Seine Estuaries, respectively. There is no seasonal variation of POC contents in the Gironde Estuary, whereas, they often increase in the Loire and the Seine Estuaries in spring and summer. The lability of the estuarine particulate organic matter was estimated by two analyses: 1/labile organic matter was measured as the organic carbon loss during incubation tests over one month; 2/ the hydrolysable organic fraction was determined after 6N HCl digestion. The organic fractions of the ETMs are mainly refractory. Any increase in the amount of POC as compared to the background levels (cited above) is always correlated to an increase of organic matter lability. The yearly average fluvial contributions by various particulate organic pools (soil and litter organic matter; organic matter of phytoplanktonic and human origin) that enter the three estuaries were quantified. In the Garonne River, soil and litter are the major (90%) POC sources. In the Loire system, due to the eutrophication of the river water, phytoplankton contributes up to 50% of the total POC load. In the Seine river, soil and litter contribute 70% of the total POC input; POC of human origin is also significant (10%), due to the impact of the City of Paris (10 million inhabitants). The lability of the different types of organic matter ranks as follows: phytoplankton ∼litter > human-origin organic matter >> soil. By combining the POC budgets and the lability of each type of organic fraction, it was possible to explain why the POC of the three ETMs is different and characterizes its refractory vs. labile nature.},

   abstract = {Microbial interactions are crucial for Earth ecosystem function, but our knowledge about them is limited and has so far mainly existed as scattered records. Here, we have surveyed the literature involving planktonic protist interactions and gathered the information in a manually curated Protist Interaction DAtabase (PIDA). In total, we have registered ~2500 ecological interactions from ~500 publications, spanning the last 150 years. All major protistan lineages were involved in interactions as hosts, symbionts (mutualists and commensalists), parasites, predators, and/or prey. Predation was the most common interaction (39% of all records), followed by symbiosis (29%), parasitism (18%), and 'unresolved interactions' (14%, where it is uncertain whether the interaction is beneficial or antagonistic). Using bipartite networks, we found that protist predators seem to be 'multivorous' while parasite-host and symbiont-host interactions appear to have moderate degrees of specialization. The SAR supergroup (i.e., Stramenopiles, Alveolata, and Rhizaria) heavily dominated PIDA, and comparisons against a global-ocean molecular survey (TARA Oceans) indicated that several SAR lineages, which are abundant and diverse in the marine realm, were underrepresented among the recorded interactions. Despite historical biases, our work not only unveils large-scale eco-evolutionary trends in the protist interactome, but it also constitutes an expandable resource to investigate protist interactions and to test hypotheses deriving from omics tools.},

All maritime countries need to assess the size of this problem and consider effective mechanisms to prevent introductions, and if necessary and where possible to monitor, contain, control or eradicate the introduced impacting organisms. Despite this, and in contrast to more enclosed water bodies, the openness of marine systems indicates that once species are in an area then eradication is usually impossible. Most institutions in countries are aware of the problem and have sufficient governance in place for management. However, there is still a general lack of commitment and concerted action plans are needed to address this problem. This paper provides recommendations resulting from an international workshop based upon a large amount of experience relating to the assessment and control of biopollution.},

We evaluated the performance of eight reagents in sediment samples of beach intertidal zones. For each of the tested reagents, different pre-treatment conditions (pre-washed; non-washed) and three different temperatures (room temperature at 26 degrees C, 60 degrees C, and 100 degrees C) were also evaluated. For each treatment (combinations between reagents, temperatures, and pre-treatment conditions), we counted diatoms cells that met the criteria necessary for taxonomic identification (Whole/Half frustules or valves without cell material) in 30 randomly chosen fields of view in definitive preparations made from the treated samples. We also compared the treatments regarding species richness and diversity observed in the definitive preparations. The reagents influenced more the conditions of diatoms cells than the temperature and pre-treatment. H2O2, HNO3, NaClO were the methods that had the best performance in relation to the number of identifiable items. The six treatments with H2O2 presented similar amounts of identifiable items, regardless of pre-treatment and temperature. HNO3 presented a higher number of identifiable items in non-washed and pre-washed treatments at 60 degrees C and non-washed at 100 degrees C. NaClO had its best performance the following treatments: non-washed at room temperature and non-washed and pre-washed at 60 degrees C. H2O2 and HNO3 also showed better results for diatom species richness and diversity, followed by NaClO. The use of H2O2 was more robust since it obtained good results regardless of temperature and pre-treatments and should be preferred. HNO3 and NaClO should be used only with the appropriate temperatures, and pre-washing should be avoided.},

The aim of this paper, conducted by the Benthos Ecology Working Group of ICES, is to describe how the principles have been translated, which were the challenges and best way forward. We have tackled the following principles: the ecosystem-based approach, the development of benthic indicators, the definition of 'pristine' or sustainable conditions, the detection of pressures and the development of monitoring programs. We concluded that testing and integrating the different approaches was facilitated during the WFD process, which led to further insights and improvements, which the MSFD can rely upon. Expert involvement in the entire implementation process proved to be of vital importance.},

   abstract = {Research spanning over 40 years has examined many aspects of the microbial ecology of the Colne estuary (Essex, United Kingdom) and it is arguably the most comprehensively understood temperate estuary in the Northern hemisphere. The hypernutrified Colne estuary exhibits strong gradients of nutrient concentrations (nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, dissolved organic nitrogen) from river and treated sewage inputs at the top of the estuary, with concentrations decreasing towards the estuary mouth. These strong concentration gradients facilitate the study of the biogeochemical process rates and the microbial communities responsible. Planktonic primary production is at an oligotrophic level because of light limitation in the turbid water, but a mixed water column maintains planktonic photosynthesis despite low light. Dense microphytobenthic biofilms occur throughout the estuary, with high rates of annual primary production typical of NW European nutrient-rich estuaries, but benthic primary production accounts for only a small proportion of the N load to the estuary. Organic matter degradation is focussed in the estuarine sediments, with greatest organic content in the upper estuary, decreasing towards the mouth. Benthic biogeochemical processes, leading to organic mineralisation and element recycling, including O2 uptake, sulphate reduction, methanogenesis, nitrate reduction, denitrification and anammox have all been quantified along the estuary, together with chemolithotrophic nitrification. Benthic denitrification removes a significant proportion of the N load to the estuary. Molecular techniques, including profiling, identification and quantification of 16S rRNA and key functional genes, have provided an understanding of the microbial communities in relation to position and biogeochemical activity. The concentrations and emissions of biological volatile compounds (nitrous oxide, methane, hydrogen sulphide and isoprene) have also been measured, and their ecological significance elucidated. Tidal exchange between the saltmarshes and the main estuary channel shows seasonal variation. When nitrate in tidal water is high in spring, the marsh sediments remove it, but tidally export ammonium and small particles of organic nitrogen to the estuary in summer when nitrogen in coastal water is low. Overall, the saltmarshes show a balanced nitrogen cycle suggestive of a stable climax community, but capable of responding to and removing increased nitrate concentrations in estuarine waters.

Statistical inferences are made in a distribution-free setting using permutational algorithms. The PERMANOVA framework is readily extended to accommodate random effects, hierarchical models, mixed models, quantitative covariates, repeated measures, unbalanced and/or asymmetrical designs, and, most recently, heterogeneous dispersions among groups. Plots to accompany PERMANOVA models include ordinations of either fitted or residualized distance matrices, including multivariate analogues to main effects and interaction plots, to visualize results.},

   abstract = {Surface sediments are important systems for the removal of anthropogenically derived inorganic nitrogen in estuaries. They are often characterized by the presence of a microphytobenthos (MPB) biofilm, which can impact bacterial communities in underlying sediments for example by secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and competition for nutrients (including nitrogen). Pyrosequencing and qPCR was performed on two intertidal surface sediments of the Westerschelde estuary characterized by a two-fold difference in MPB biomass but no difference in MPB composition. Doubling of MPB biomass was accompanied by a disproportionately (ten-fold) increase in total bacterial abundances while, unexpectedly, no difference in general community structure was observed, despite significantly lower bacterial richness and distinct community membership, mostly for non-abundant taxa. Denitrifier abundances corresponded likewise while community structure, both for nirS and nirK denitrifiers, remained unchanged, suggesting that competition with diatoms for nitrate is negligible at concentrations in the investigated sediments (appr. 1 mg/l NO3-). This study indicates that MPB biomass increase has a general, significantly positive effect on total bacterial and denitrifier abundances, with stimulation or inhibition of specific bacterial groups that however do not result in a re-structured community.},

   abstract = {Biodiversity has traditionally been quantified using taxonomic information but the importance of also considering its functional characteristics has recently gained an increasing attention among microorganisms. However, studies exploring multiple aspects of taxonomic and functional diversity and their temporal variations are scarce for diatoms, which is one of the most important microbial groups in aquatic ecosystems. Here, our aim was to examine the taxonomic and functional alpha and beta diversities of diatoms in a coastal rock pool system characterized by a naturally high environmental heterogeneity. We also investigated the temporal differences in the diversity patterns and drivers. The relationship between the species richness and functional dispersion was temporally coherent, such that species-poor communities tended to be functionally clustered. The trend between the species richness and taxonomic uniqueness of community composition was temporally inconsistent, changing from negative to non-significant over time. Conductivity or distance to the sea or both were key determinants of species richness, functional dispersion, and uniqueness of community composition. The increase of community dissimilarity with an increasing environmental distance was stronger for the taxonomic than the functional composition. Our results suggest that even minor decreases in the species richness may result in a lowered functional diversity and decreased ecosystem functioning. Species-poor ecosystems may, however, have unique species compositions and high contributions to regional biodiversity. Despite changing the species compositions along the environmental gradients, communities may remain to have a high functional similarity and robustness in the face of environmental changes. Our results highlight the advantage of considering multiple biodiversity metrics and incorporating a temporal component for a deeper understanding of the effects of environmental changes on microbial biodiversity.},

A remarkable tabellarioid ribbon-forming diatom with a very distinctive pattern of plastid distribution and unique valve and girdle band characters is described from Guam (Mariana Islands) as a new genus and species, Hanicella moenia. We were able to study the ultrastructure and ontogeny of the girdle bands, to compare several other genera in the Striatellales and the Rhabdonematales with numerous septate copulae and hyaline, nonseptate pleurae, and to evaluate their phylogenetic relationships. The last-formed two copulae of Microtabella interrupta have distended septa, the last interlocking with the other via a transverse ridge between two unique "ligules." The fourth pleura of Hanicella is a delicate, fimbriate band. Views of developing copulae of H. moenia indicated that the septum was formed by ingrowth from the sides rather than from the apex; this blurs the distinction between septate and scalariform valvocopulae. Phylogenetic results (i) confirmed that the Striatellales and Striatellaceae, consisting of Striatella and Pseudostriatella, are unrelated to clades containing Hyalosira, Microtabella, Hanicella, and Rhabdonema; and (ii) showed that the fRhabdonemataceae is close to, but separate from, the strongly supported Hanicella/Microtabella/Grammatophora clade, for which we propose Grammatophoraceae fam. nov. Formal genus and species descriptions of H. moenia are given and we also propose to restore Hyalosira interrupta to Microtabella with an emended genus description.},

The index is based on a suite of 86 taxa selected both for their indicator value and ease of identification. When tested on a dataset from 70 sites free of significant organic pollution, this index was more highly correlated with aqueous P concentrations than previous diatom indices. However, where there was heavy organic pollution, it was difficult to separate the effects of eutrophication from other effects. For this reason, the value of TDI is supplemented by an indication of the proportion of the sample that is composed of taxa tolerant to organic pollution.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: Diatom-dominated microphytobenthos (MPB) communities of 4 intertidal mudflats along the meso- and polyhaline reaches of the Loire Estuary, France, were investigated during a year cycle. They were analysed in terms of biomass, diversity, species composition and growth form distribution. The assemblages of the 2 upstream sites were characterised by high biomass and lower diversities and were mostly dominated by epipelon. The 2 downstream, most haline sites had lower biomass and higher diversities and were dominated by both epipelon and tychoplankton. Diversity did not exhibit a clear seasonal signal in the upstream mudflats, but it was higher during the first half of the study in the downstream sites. The coexistence of 2 growth forms seems to increase diversity of the mudflat assemblages. Species distribution was mainly linked to changes in sediment texture and salinity, both with a marked seasonal variability. MPB biomass was inversely related to MPB diversity and positively related to both mud content and the epipelon. MPB diversity was not, however, significantly correlated with mud content. Slight changes in sediment texture, even if causing variations in assemblage composition, did not change overall diversity. The existence of an important and even dominant tychoplanktonic fraction could be considered a distinctive feature of these benthic environments in the Loire, as well as in other macrotidal estuaries.},

   abstract = {The high local-scale species diversity of marine meiofauna, and of nematodes in particular, has puzzled ecologists for decades. Both pronounced niche differentiation and neutral dynamics have been suggested as mechanisms underlying that high diversity. Differential resource use is the most plausible basis for niche differentiation, yet the vast majority of studies demonstrating that this is prominent in marine nematodes are based on laboratory experiments on single species or highly simplified assemblages. Only a small number of studies have investigated resource differentiation under natural conditions. Here we use natural stable-isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen, as well as fatty-acid profiles, to assess differential resource use and trophic structure in nine abundant estuarine tidal flat nematode species, comprising different presumed feeding modes (deposit feeders, epistratum feeders, predators) and resource guilds (herbivores, carnivores) based on buccal cavity morphology. Nematodes comprise up to three different trophic levels (from primary to tertiary consumers), yet with the exception of some herbivores, omnivory is prominent. Bivariate isotopic niche spaces were of similar size among most species, irrespective of their trophic level. Herbivory not only contributed importantly to the nutrition of suspected herbivores, but also to that of species that were previously considered carnivores based on the morphology of their buccal cavity. Herbivory mainly targets diatoms in some nematode species, yet includes dinoflagellates in others. Bacteria, in contrast, appear to be of limited nutritional importance. Odontophora setosus is identified as a predator/omnivore (possibly of heterotrophic protists) with a trophic level in between that of secondary and tertiary consumers. Our study thus demonstrates that resource differentiation is pronounced among as well as within nematode feeding modes and resource guilds. However, this study included only the most abundant species of the in situ community, hence it remains to be established whether and to what extent its conclusions can be extrapolated to entire, often highly species-rich communities.},

Changes since have improved the resolution of many nodes in phylogenetic analyses. For some clades even families are being clearly resolved. As we had predicted, environmental sampling in the intervening years has massively increased the genetic information at hand. Consequently, we have discovered novel clades, exciting new genera and uncovered a massive species level diversity beyond the morphological species descriptions. Several clades known from environmental samples only have now found their home. Sampling soils, deeper marine waters and the deep sea will continue to fill us with surprises. The main changes in this revision are the confirmation that eukaryotes form at least two domains, the loss of monophyly in the Excavata, robust support for the Haptista and Cryptista. We provide suggested primer sets for DNA sequences from environmental samples that are effective for each clade. We have provided a guide to trophic functional guilds in an appendix, to facilitate the interpretation of environmental samples, and a standardized taxonomic guide for East Asian users.},

@article{Benito2003,
   abstract = {A relational database using Access, and an interface based on a Geographical Information System (GIS) with ArcView program, were created to allow spatial-temporal analysis of documentary flood data collected for the Tagus basin (Central Spain). High flood frequencies were registered in the periods: AD 1160–1210 (3%), 1540–1640 (11%; peak at 1590–1610), 1730–1760 (5%), 1780–1810 (4%), 1870–1900 (19%), 1930–1950 (17%) and 1960–1980 (12%). Flood magnitudes of those documentary events were estimated at four sites (Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera and Alcántara) along the Tagus River using HEC-RAS Computer program, matching the calculated water surface profiles with historical references of flood stage. The largest floods took place during the periods AD 1168–1211 (Toledo and Talavera), AD 1658–1706 (Talavera), AD 1870–1900, and AD 1930–1950 (Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera and Alcántara). The temporal distribution of flood magnitude and frequency is discussed within the context of climatic variability experienced by the Iberian Peninsula. Although flood producing mechanisms of Atlantic and Mediterranean basins of the Iberian Peninsula are related to different, independent atmospheric patterns, there is a clear coincidence between most periods showing high flood frequencies. These periods of high flooding seem to correspond to the initial and final decades of periods with climate deterioration described at the continental scale. This suggests that climatic variability over the last millennium has induced a response in hydrological extremes (positive or negative), irrespective of the flood-producing mechanism.},

   abstract = {The Surirellales and Rhopalodiales are large, widespread, and morphologically diverse groups of raphid pennate diatoms (Bacillariphyta) whose raphe, a structure that facilitates active motility, opens internally into a siliceous canal. We collected 202 representatives of the lineage and sequenced genes from the nuclear, plastid, and mitochondrial genomes to infer phylogenetic relationships as a basis for comparative study of ecology and morphological evolution as well as reclassification. The lineage was ancestrally marine, and we report the first evidence for a 'stepping stone' model of marine-freshwater transitions in which freshwater invasions were preceded by adaptation to intermediate brackish habitats. Phylogenetic comparative analyses also showed that the shift from an apical (e.g., Entomoneis) to transapical major axis of development (e.g., Surirella) did not have to proceed through subcircular intermediate forms (i.e., Campylodiscus). Rather, subcircular forms evolved both within lineages with longer apical axis or longer transapical axis. We also used the inferred phylogeny as a basis for genus-level reclassification of the lineage. Campylodiscus now includes the fastuosoid members of Surirella and Campylodiscus, but excludes other marine Campylodiscus which are now classified as Coronia. Surirella includes the Surirella striatula clade, Surirella Pinnatae group, and species formerly classified as Cymatopleura. We resurrected the genus Iconella to accommodate Stenopterobia and the robustoid members of Surirella and Campylodiscus. We broadened Epithemia to include members of the paraphyletic genus Rhopalodia. Finally, we discuss the challenges of constructing a classification that best leverages available phylogenetic data, while minimizing disruption to the research community and recognizing practical considerations stemming from the slow rate of progress on systematic studies of understudied organisms.},

Field investigation of community dynamics of microphytobenthos (MPB) was conducted from August 2006 to August 2007 in intertidal flats of the Nakdong River estuary, Korea. MPB Biomass varied between 0.47 and 16.58 μg cm−3 in the surface 1 cm sediment, with two dominant diatom species, Amphora coffeaeformis and Navicula sp., occupying average 77.2 ± 14.9% of total number of MPB cells. The biomass was higher in the slightly muddy sand sites than that in the sand site, and showed different pattern of seasonal variation. The profile of vertical distribution of biomass was an exponential decrease trend with depth in sediments. The biomass proportions in the uppermost 3 mm were 57.6% and 37.8% with and without the presence of biofilm, respectively. The two dominant species were cultured in laboratory, and their photosynthetic parameters, rETRmax (relative maximum electron transport rate), α (light utilization coefficient) and Ek(light saturation parameter) were derived from rETR (relative ETR)-irradiance curves by Imaging- PAM (pulse amplitude modulated) fluorometry. The rETR-irradiance curves showed no significant difference of photosynthetic activities between the two species. The areal potential production ranged from 0.74 to 2.22 g C m−2 d−1.},

   abstract = {In recent times many benthic indices have been proposed to assess the ecological quality of marine waters worldwide. In this study we compared single metrics and multi-metric methods to assess coastal and transitional benthic status along human pressure gradients in five distinct environments across Europe: Varna bay and lake (Bulgaria), Lesina lagoon (Italy), Mondego estuary (Portugal), Basque coast (Spain) and Oslofjord (Norway). Hence, 13 single metrics (abundance, number of taxa, and several diversity and sensitivity indices) and eight of the most common indices used within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) for benthic assessment were selected: index of size spectra (ISS), Benthic assessment tool (BAT), Norwegian quality index (NQI), Multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI), Benthic quality index (BQI), (Benthic ecosystem quality index (BEQI), Benthic index based on taxonomic sufficiency (BITS), and infaunal quality index (IQI). Within each system, sampling sites were ordered in an increasing pressure gradient according to a preliminary classification based on professional judgement. The different indices are largely consistent in their response to pressure gradient, except in some particular cases (i.e. BITS, in all cases, or ISS when a low number of individuals is present). Inconsistencies between indicator responses were most pronounced in transitional waters (i.e. IQI, BEQI), highlighting the difficulties of the generic application of indicators to all marine, estuarine and lagoonal environments. However, some of the single (i.e. ecological groups approach, diversity, richness) and multi-metric methods (i.e. BAT, M-AMBI, NQI) were able to detect such gradients both in transitional and coastal environments, being these multi-metric methods more consistent in the detection than single indices. This study highlights the importance of survey design and good reference conditions for some indicators. The agreement observed between different methodologies and their ability to detect quality trends across distinct environments constitutes a promising result for the implementation of the WFD's monitoring plans. Moreover, these results have management implications, regarding the dangers of misclassification, uncertainty in the assessment, use of conflicting indices, and testing and validation of indices.},

   abstract = {Epizoic diatoms form an important part of micro-epibiota of marine vertebrates such as whales and sea turtles. The present study explores and compares the diversity and biogeography of diatom communities growing on the skin and shell of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from four different localities: Adriatic Sea (Croatia), Ionian Sea (Greece), South Africa and Florida Bay (USA) using both light and scanning electron microscopy. We observed almost 400 diatom taxa belonging to more than 100 genera. Diatom communities from Greece and Croatia showed the highest similarity and were statistically different from those recorded from South Africa and Florida. Part of this variation could be attributed to differences in sampling techniques; however, we believe that geography had an important role. In general, contrary to several previous observations from sea turtles, the presumably exclusively epizoic diatoms contributed less than common benthic taxa to the total diatom flora, which might have been related to the loggerhead feeding behavior. Moreover, skin samples differed from carapace samples in having a distinct diatom composition with a higher proportion of the putative true epizoonts. Our results indicate that epizoic diatom communities differ according to loggerhead geographical location and substrate (skin vs. carapace). The relative abundances of common benthic diatoms and putative exclusive epizoic taxa may inform about sea turtle habitat use or behavior though detailed comparisons among different host species have yet to be performed.},

   abstract = {The resuspension dynamics of microphytobenthos (MPB) and sediment fluxes were investigated in a disturbed coastal environment by employing an in situ mooring system. We aimed to identify the interrelationship between microalgal biomass and sediment particles in aspect of their (de)coupling mechanism in a tidal channel system. In specific, the Chl-a (as a proxy of MPB biomass) and the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) were simultaneously measured under natural tidal conditions at different time scales, encompassing daily to fortnightly variations. Looking for the sediment dynamics, the SSC showed a strong positive correlation (p < 0.001) with the Reynolds stress; however, this relationship was not observed for benthic Chl-a. This could be due to more dynamic characteristics of the smaller biological cells, i.e., the decoupled benthic Chl-a from the sediment particles might randomly distribute in the turbid water column above the tidal channel. Notably, the iteration between MPB coupling (prevailing in spring) and segregation (prevailing in neap) with the sediment particles across the flood and ebb tidal cycles was evident during the study period. Meantime, the onshore flux of suspended sediment was almost balanced by its offshore flux, but that of Chl-a appeared to be unbalanced due to an excessive onshore transport. Altogether, the study area seems to experience a time lag in resuspension between MPB and sediment, followed by biological trapping in the tidal channel system, which would support a productive shallow water environment. The present study is the first to address the tidal resuspension of benthic microalgae in relation to sediment dynamics in a disturbed coastal environment of the Yellow Sea.},

   abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of microphytobenthos biomass and photosynthetic performances in intertidal ecosystems will help advance our understanding of how trophic networks function in order to optimize ecological management and restoration projects. The main objective of this study was to investigate microphytobenthic biomass and photosynthetic performances as a function of the sedimentary and environmental variabilities in the range of intertidal habitats in the downstream Seine estuary (Normandy, France). Our results highlight higher biomass associated with more stratified biofilms and better photosynthetic performances in areas characterized by a sand/mud mixture (40-60% of mud) compared to pure sand or pure mud environments. This type of sediment probably offers an efficient trade-off between the favorable characteristics of the two types of sediments (sand and mud) with respect to light penetration and nutrient accessibility. Moreover, the large quantities of exopolysaccharides produced in sand/mud mixtures emphasizes the functional role played by microphytobenthos in promoting sediment stability against erosion. This allows us to show that despite the strong increase in sand content of the downstream Seine estuary, intertidal flats are still productive since microphytobenthic biomass, photosynthetic performances and exopolysaccharides secretion are highest in sand-mud mixtures. This study also underlines the impact of ecosystem modifications due to human disturbance and climate change on the dynamics of key primary producers in estuaries.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: Pennate diatoms are the main group of primary producers in transient microbial biofilms at the sediment surface in muddy intertidal systems. These microalgae produce a substantial quantity of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that contribute significantly to the cohesive properties observed in biofilms. Changes in carbohydrate content and composition and the persistence of diatom EPS were demonstrated with pulse-chase NaH<sup>13</sup>CO<sub>3</sub> labeling and simultaneous detection of isotopic enrichment in polysaccharides and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in Colne Estuary, UK, biofilms over a 48 h period. Significant isotopic enrichment of glucan indicated that a large proportion of fixed carbon was initially sequestered into intracellular chrysolaminaran, and labeled carbon was also quickly used for production of the diatom PLFA 20:5ω3 and EPS. Saccharides in the EPS fractions were enriched rapidly, followed by labeling of distinct bacterial PLFAs through heterotrophic utilization of EPS within 4 h. Maximal isotopic enrichment of diatom and Gram-negative bacterial PLFAs and hot water- and hot bicarbonate-soluble EPS fractions occurred after 4 h, and <sup>13</sup>C-labeling increased in Gram-positive bacterial PLFAs throughout the study period. After 48 h, PLFAs remained highly labeled relative to diatom-derived polysaccharides, indicating persistence of assimilated C in organisms within the biofilms through time and rapid turnover of polysaccharide pools within the biofilms. Coupled pulse-chase isotopic labeling and simultaneous tracking of <sup>13</sup>C in polysaccharides and PLFAs directly demonstrated the flow of carbon between biofilm autotrophs and heterotrophic bacteria and the significance of diatom-derived carbohydrates in this exchange.},

   abstract = {Benthic diatoms have been universally used as indicators to assess water quality in lotic ecosystems. However, most diatom-based indices developed in Europe have not been widely used or tested in other continents such as Asia or Oceania. This study compared the performance of 14 widely-applied diatom indices in assessing ecological conditions in subtropical streams in South East Queensland (SEQ) in Australia and in the upper Han River in China. Most water quality variables in the upper Han River including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) had strong relationships with at least one diatom index, with the exception of IDAP (Index Diatom Artois-Picardie), and TDI (Trophic Diatom Index). However, in SEQ, most of the environmental variables including DOC, ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), TN, SRP, and electrical conductivity (EC) showed no significant relationships with diatom indices, and the DI-CH (Swiss Diatom Index) and WAT (Watanabe's Index) were unrelated to any of the variables examined. Only pH and nitrite or nitrate nitrogen (NOX-N) were significant predictors of several diatom indices in SEQ, especially TID (Rott trophic index). In the upper Han River, much of the spatial variation in most diatom indices was explained by proximate determinants alone, including EC, DOC, dissolved oxygen (DO) or SRP, or a combination of ultimate (canopy, forest) and proximate factors (R(2) in most models> 0.75). Most diatom indices performed as predicted in the upper Han River where nutrient and organic matter pollution was relatively high, and variation in pH low. However, the indices performed poorly in SEQ where the water quality gradient was low and instead most responded to spatial variation in pH. This finding serves as a caution to the application of diatom indices in river basins that fall outside of the range of water quality values of the systems in which they originally developed.},

   abstract = {Optimal packing of 2 and 3-D shapes in confined spaces has long been of practical and theoretical interest, particularly as it has been discovered that rotatable ellipses (or ellipsoids in the 3-D case) can, for example, have higher packing densities than disks (or spheres in the 3-D case). Benthic diatoms, particularly those of the genus Cocconeis (Ehr.)-which are widely regarded as prolific colonisers of immersed surfaces-often have a flattened (adnate) cell shape and an approximately elliptical outline or "footprint" that allows them to closely contact the substratum. Adoption of this shape may give these cells a number of advantages as they colonise surfaces, such as a higher packing fraction for colonies on a surface for more efficient use of limited space, or an increased contact between individual cells when cell abundances are high, enabling the cells to minimize energy use and maximize packing (and biofilm) stability on a surface. Here, the outline shapes of individual diatom cells are measured using scanning electron and epifluorescence microscopy to discover if the average cell shape compares favourably with those predicted by theoretical modelling of efficient 2-D ellipse packing. It is found that the aspect ratio of measured cells in close association in a biofilm-which are broadly elliptical in shape-do indeed fall within the range theoretically predicted for optimal packing, but that the shape of individual diatoms also differ subtly from that of a true ellipse. The significance of these differences for optimal packing of 2-D shapes on surfaces is not understood at present, but may represent an opportunity to further explore bio-inspired design shapes for the optimal packing of shapes on surfaces.},

In this study, a 12-year phytoplankton time-series was used to investigate the contribution of benthic microalgae to the pelagic system at a site along the French-Atlantic coast. Furthermore, all taxa identified were allocated into different growth forms in order to study their seasonal patterns. The highest contribution of benthic microalgae was observed during the winter period, reaching up to 60% of the carbon biomass in the water column. The haptobenthic growth form showed the highest contribution in terms of biomass, dominant in the fall-winter period when the turbidity and the river flow were high. The epipelic growth form did not follow any seasonal pattern. The epiphytic diatom Licmophora was most commonly found during summer. As benthic microalgae were found in the water column throughout the year, the temporal variation detected in the structure of pelagic assemblages in a macrotidal ecosystem was partly derived from the differentiated contribution of several benthic growth forms.},

We observed cells before and after sexual reproduction in monoclonal cultures using light and scanning electron microscopy (LM and SEM). After sexual reproduction cells were approximately twice as large as before, in valve length and width. The stria and infundibula densities were stable during the life cycle. Subtle morphological differences were detectable between the two poles of the frustule. One pole (pole A) was characterized by endings of the external raphe fissure that turned toward the valve face, continuity of the domed wall of the raphe canal externally, an elliptic chamber visible internally, a shallow nick in the interior of the valvocopula. The other pole (pole B) was with the following: straight endings of the external raphe fissures, a dent in the domed wall of the raphe canal externally, a double chamber internally, presence of the open ends of the valvocopula nearby, a deep nick in the valvocopula. Furthermore, at pole A virgae developed at an early stage in morphogenesis, whereas at pole B they were not formed. In the auxospores, pole A was situated beneath the primary transverse perizonial band. Pole A is suggested to be homologous with the head pole in heteropolar Surirella and is the "protopole" likely equivalent to the central nodule in naviculoid taxa. Pole B is homologous with the foot pole in heteropolar Surirella and is the "synaptic pole" formed by fusion of components equivalent to both poles of naviculoid taxa.},

   abstract = {This is the first report on viriobenthos activity within the microbial biofilm located at the top-surface of the intertidal mudflat during emersion in Marennes-Oleron Bay (France). By combining in situ and ex situ approaches, the viral production (VP) was linked to the dynamics of prokaryotes and microphytobenthos (MPB). VP averaged 2-4 x 10(8) viruses ml(-1) h(-1). VP correlated positively with the Virus to Prokaryote Ratio, and both were correlated negatively with the water content. The virus-induced mortality of prokaryotes was lower in winter than in summer (6.8 vs. 39.7% of the production) and the C-shunting may supply 2-12% of their Carbon Demand, respectively. VP accounted for 79% of loss in Prokaryotes but the response was delayed compared to the increase in VP suggesting a simultaneous release of viruses of MPB origin. This hypothesis is supported by capsid-sizing of virions by transmission electronic microscopy and bioassays. Harvesting and ex situ maintenance of top-surface sediments was carried out to monitor the dynamics of viruses, prokaryotes and MPB after inoculation with benthic or planktonic viruses. Benthic viruses modified the prokaryotic and MPB dynamics and decreased the photosynthesis efficiency in contrast to planktonic viruses that impacted MPB but not the prokaryotes.},

The families with the highest number of occurrences were Bacillariaceae (176), Achnanthidiaceae (135) and Naviculaceae (133). The two diatom endemisms, described previously in Madeira Island (Lange-Bertalot 1993), Nitzschia macaronesica Lange-Bertalot and Navicula madeirensis Lange-Bertalot, were only observed in a small number of sites, located mostly at Laurissilva forest. Sixty species are new records, not only to Madeira Island, but also to the Madeira Archipelago.},

   abstract = {Changes in the size structure of photoautotrophs influence food web structure and the biogeochemical cycling of carbon. Decreases in the median size of diatoms within communities, in concert with climate warming and water column stratification, have been observed over the Cenozoic in the ocean and over the last 50 years in Lake Tahoe. Decreases in the proportion of larger plankton are frequently observed in response to reduced concentrations of limiting nutrients in marine systems and large stratified lakes. By contrast, we show a decrease in the median size of planktonic diatoms in response to higher nutrient concentrations in a set of intermediate-sized alkaline lakes. Climate-induced increases in the frequency, duration and strength of water column stratification may select smaller planktonic species in the ocean and larger lakes owing to a reduction in nutrient availability and sinking rates, while light limitation, stimulated by nutrient eutrophication and high chlorophyll concentrations, may select smaller species within a community owing to their high light absorption efficiencies and lower sinking rates. The relative importance of different physiological and ecological rates and processes on the size structure of communities varies in different aquatic systems owing to varying combinations of abiotic and biotic constraints.},

   abstract = {In an effort to identify the causes and patterns of temporal change in periphytic communities, we examined biomass accumulation, taxonomic and functional composition, rate of species turnover, and pairwise species correlations in response to variability in current velocity and nutrient supply in artificial stream flumes. Divergent patterns in community growth and succession were observed between nutrient treatments and, to a lesser extent, between flow treatments best described by shifts in taxonomic and functional composition. Specifically, understory low profile species, tolerant to low resource supply, became dominant under low nutrients, while overstory high profile and motile species with higher nutrient demands dominated the high nutrient treatments. Increased resource supply or current velocity did not influence the species turnover rate, measured by a time-lag analysis. Interspecific interactions, especially competition, did not appear to be driving community dynamics, as the number of positive and negative pairwise species correlations ranged between low and extremely low, respectively. The overwhelming majority of correlations were not significant, indicating that species within the biofilm matrix were not perceptibly influencing one another. Thus, temporal trends in taxonomic and functional composition were largely environmentally driven, signifying that coexistence in biofilms is defined by the same mechanism along the hierarchy from species to functional groups.},

Separately, the diatoms were exposed to C12-LAS in a water-only system. The algal growth was determined after 72 h. The 72-h ErC50 values ranged from <or=4 to 29 mg/kg sediment, suggesting that C. closterium was sensitive to LAS. The outcomes were reproducible with a variation factor lower than 3, showing the reproducibility of the method. The test set up was cost effective, used little bench space and employed a micro-phytobenthos species that fulfilled most of the criteria for a suitable test species in sediment systems. The 72-h ErC50 obtained in a water-only system (0.141 mg/L) was ca. 2 orders of magnitude lower (0.002 mg/L). This was likely due to an indirect effect of the use of fresh sediment.},

However, our knowledge on seasonal and inter-annual variation in the composition and diversity of communities is still poor. Here, we investigated the seasonal and inter-annual changes in taxonomic and functional community composition and diversity of benthic diatoms in a coastal habitat of the northern Baltic Sea, where seasonal and inter-annual variation of climate is pronounced. We found that the taxonomic and functional alpha diversity remained stable at seasonal and inter-annual level despite strong changes in community composition. However, alpha diversity decreased during an exceptionally warm winter possibly due to disturbances induced by the lack of ice. This may suggest that climate warming and consequently limited ice cover will affect the diversity of benthic communities.},

   abstract = {The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a pioneering piece of legislation that aims to protect and enhance aquatic ecosystems and promote sustainable water use across Europe. There is growing concern that the objective of good status, or higher, in all EU waters by 2027 is a long way from being achieved in many countries. Through questionnaire analysis of almost 100 experts, we provide recommendations to enhance WFD monitoring and assessment systems, improve programmes of measures and further integrate with other sectoral policies. Our analysis highlights that there is great potential to enhance assessment schemes through strategic design of monitoring networks and innovation, such as earth observation. New diagnostic tools that use existing WFD monitoring data, but incorporate novel statistical and trait-based approaches could be used more widely to diagnose the cause of deterioration under conditions of multiple pressures and deliver a hierarchy of solutions for more evidence-driven decisions in river basin management. There is also a growing recognition that measures undertaken in river basin management should deliver multiple benefits across sectors, such as reduced flood risk, and there needs to be robust demonstration studies that evaluate these. Continued efforts in 'mainstreaming' water policy into other policy sectors is clearly needed to deliver wider success with WFD goals, particularly with agricultural policy. Other key policy areas where a need for stronger integration with water policy was recognised included urban planning (waste water treatment), flooding, climate and energy (hydropower). Having a deadline for attaining the policy objective of good status is important, but even more essential is to have a permanent framework for river basin management that addresses the delays in implementation of measures. This requires a long-term perspective, far beyond the current deadline of 2027.},

   abstract = {Detailed morphological documentation is provided for established Proschkinia taxa, including the generitype, P. bulnheimii, and P. complanata, P. complanatula, P. complanatoides and P. hyalosirella, and six new species. All established taxa are characterized from original material from historical collections. The new species described in this paper (P. luticola, P. staurospeciosa, P. impar, P. modesta, P. fistulispectabilis, and P. rosowskii) were isolated from the Western Pacific (Yellow Sea coast of Korea) and the Atlantic (Scottish and Texas coasts). Thorough documentation of the frustule, valve and protoplast architecture revealed the combination of characters diagnostic of the genus Proschkinia: a single-lobed chloroplast; a broad girdle composed of U-shaped, perforated bands; the position of the conopeate raphe-sternum relative to the external and internal valve surface; and the presence of an occluded process through the valve, termed the "fistula". Seven strains of Proschkinia were grown in culture and five of these were sequenced for nuclear ribosomal SSU and plastid-encoded rbcL. Phylogenetic analysis recovered a clade of Proschkinia with Fistulifera, another fistula-bearing diatom genus, and together these were sister to a clade formed of the Stauroneidaceae; in turn, all of these were sister to a clade composed of Parlibellus and two monoraphid genera Astartiella and Schizostauron. Despite morphological similarities between Proschkinia and the Naviculaceae, these two taxa are distant in our analysis. We document the variation in the morphology of Proschkinia, including significant variability in the fistula, suggesting that fistula ultrastructure might be one of the key features for species identification within the genus.},

   abstract = {Light in the marine environment is a key environmental variable coupling physics to marine biogeochemistry and ecology. Weak light penetration reduces light available for photosynthesis, changing energy fluxes through the marine food web. Based on published and unpublished data, this study shows that the central and southern North Sea has become significantly less clear over the second half of the 20th century. In particular, in the different regions and seasons investigated, the average Secchi depth pre-1950 decreased between 25% and 75% compared to the average Secchi depth post-1950. Consequently, in summer pre-1950, most (74%) of the sea floor in the permanently mixed area off East Anglia was within the photic zone. For the last 25+ years, changes in water clarity were more likely driven by an increase in the concentration of suspended sediments, rather than phytoplankton. We suggest that a combination of causes have contributed to this increase in suspended sediments such as changes in sea-bed communities and in weather patterns, decreased sink of sediments in estuaries, and increased coastal erosion. A predicted future increase in storminess (Beniston et al., 2007; Kovats et al., 2014) could enhance the concentration of suspended sediments in the water column and consequently lead to a further decrease in clarity, with potential impacts on phytoplankton production, CO2 fluxes, and fishery production.},

   abstract = {Legislation in Europe has been adopted to determine and improve the ecological integrity of inland and coastal waters. Assessment is based on four biotic groups, including benthic macroinvertebrate communities. For lakes, benthic invertebrates have been recognized as one of the most difficult organism groups to use in ecological assessment, and hitherto their use in ecological assessment has been limited. In this study, we review and intercalibrate 13 benthic invertebrate-based tools across Europe. These assessment tools address different human impacts: acidification (3 methods), eutrophication (3 methods), morphological alterations (2 methods), and a combination of the last two (5 methods). For intercalibration, the methods were grouped into four intercalibration groups, according to the habitat sampled and putative pressure. Boundaries of the 'good ecological status' were compared and harmonized using direct or indirect comparison approaches. To enable indirect comparison of the methods, three common pressure indices and two common biological multimetric indices were developed for larger geographical areas. Additionally, we identified the best-performing methods based on their responsiveness to different human impacts. Based on these experiences, we provide practical recommendations for the development and harmonization of benthic invertebrate assessment methods in lakes and similar habitats.},

   abstract = {In the presence of different environmental stressors, diatoms can produce frustules presenting different types of deformities. Metals and trace elements are among the most common causes of these teratological forms. Metal enrichment in water bodies can be attributed to the geological setting of the area or to pollution. The widespread benthic diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum (ADMI) is one of the most metal-tolerant species. In the present study, ADMI teratologies were defined from samples taken from eight very diverse, widely-distributed inland-water habitats: streams affected by active and abandoned mining areas, a metal-contaminated stream, a spring in an old chalcopyrite mine, a mineral-water fountain, and a sediment core taken from a lake affected by metal contamination in the past. Deformed frustules of ADMI were characterised mainly by one (sometimes two) more or less bent off ending, conferring to the specimens a cymbelloid outline (cymbelliclinum-like teratology, CLT). Marked teratologies were distinguished from slight deformities. Hydrochemical analyses, including metals and trace elements, were carried out and enrichment factors (EF) relative to average crustal composition were calculated. To improve our knowledge on the potential of different metals and trace elements to trigger the occurrence of ADMI CLT, we carefully selected 15 springs out of 110 (CRENODAT dataset) where both ADMI and above-average metal or metalloid concentrations occurred, and re-analysed these samples. The results from the eight widely-distributed core sites as well as from the 15 selected CRENODAT springs led to the hypothesis that two metals (copper and zinc) and a metalloid (antimony) were the most likely triggers of ADMI CLT formation. From a quantitative point of view, it is worth noting that the lowest concentrations triggering ADMI CLT can be fairly low, particularly in the case of copper contamination. The antimony-rich site was characterised by a marked-teratology variant where both ends of ADMI were bent off.},

   abstract = {This study forms the first basic assessment of microphytobenthos (MPB) dynamics in micro-estuaries and micro-outlets in southern Africa. It examines MPB community responses to environmental variables and further investigates MPB composition qualitatively across different micro-estuaries and micro-outlets over four seasons in a warm temperate region of the subcontinent. Combinations of multivariate analyses were used to explore similarities and differences in MPB communities between systems. Human-induced catchment changes between microsystems ranged from no alteration (rating 0; mostly micro-outlets) to extreme modification (rating 5; mostly micro-estuaries). Two hundred and sixty-seven MPB taxa were identified within all the microsystems, with 247 and 230 MPB taxa being observed in the micro-estuaries and micro-outlets, respectively. The MPB communities differed slightly in terms of microsystem types and seasons, but no significant differences were observed. Multivariate analyses (i.e. Boosted Regression Trees, Canonical Correspondence Analysis) showed that water column variables were significant and important in structuring MPB communities, with soluble reactive phosphorus, sediment pH, turbidity, ammonium and temperature being documented as key drivers. The MPB community composition clearly reflected the influence of catchment anthropogenic activities on species composition and structure. Moderately modified catchments resulted in MPB community structure variation among water bodies in relationship to land use and salinity gradients. The study found that; (i) by virtue of their size, microsystems and their catchments are likely to be particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures when compared to systems of larger size; (ii) a typical impacted state may reflect reduced environmental heterogeneity which, compared to larger systems, may be achieved over much shorter time periods (following a particular event) or under much less intensive impacts; and (iii) the response in terms of MPB structure may predictably reflect a concomitant change from a complex community dynamic (structure and spatio-temporal attributes) to one that approaches a homogeneous structure (poor spatial zonation, strong taxonomic dominance, low species diversity).},

   abstract = {Achieving a purified fraction of diatom frustules from soft sediment samples is an essential requirement for using their biogenic silica as a carrier of paleolimnological and paleoenvironmental information. Because diatom frustules behave hydrodynamically unlike most mineral grains, these types of particles can theoretically be separated in liquids. Based on this principle, a new method has been developed, which employs split-flow thin fractionation (SPLITT) as a tool for separating diatom frustules from other sedimentary particles. The SPLITT channel selected for this study had a length of 20 cm, a breadth of 4 cm, and a height of 371 µm. For optimum results, samples were pretreated, e.g., suspended and wet-sieved prior to any processing with the SPLITT cell. The sample concentrations used in the fractionation process were below 0.1% (w/v) to minimize particle-particle interaction, which affects the quality of the separation. The advantages of SPLITT fractionation over other tested methods are good reproducibility, high throughput by continuous flow, minimum losses of frustules, and minimum contamination of the diatom fraction by minerals or sponge spicules. Separation results from representative sediment samples of different origin, age, and compaction as well as various organic (0.5% to 10% total organic carbon) and biogenic opal contents (1% to 20% biogenic silica) are presented and discussed. They demonstrate that the developed separation technique yields highly purified and, within the processing tolerances, quantitative samples of diatom frustules from bulk lacustrine sediments.},

   abstract = {The impact of the presence of us humans as well as our activities to nature has led to over-exploitation of natural resources and to dramatic changes in land-use including the use of artificial fertilizers contributes to the deterioration of the natural environment. The population density, industrial processes and the use of fertilizers are the main causes for the eutrophication of river systems, estuaries and seas. There are several ways to determine the actual nutrient levels back to the 1950s, back to 1900 or even back to 1800. Available data indicate that the natural background concentrations of nutrients (pristine conditions or the period prior to the widespread use of artificial fertilizers and detergents) were dramatically lower than today. Available time series on chemical and biological data collected from different parts of the world show the (sometimes tremendous) increase in nutrient levels and the related productivity. The same time series, however, also show the decreases in values when measures were taken to reduce the nutrient emissions. Investigations of different systems all over the world show that nearly every system responses differently to eutrophication. Especially physical boundary conditions play an important role in the manifestation of the ultimate effect of local eutrophication. Apart from the physical boundary conditions also the transformation and retention of nutrients in estuarine and coastal systems contribute to system specific responses. Depending on all these different conditions, site specific responses with even site specific problems may occur. The challenge of this millennium is to really reach a balance between nature and mankind including its population size. A beneficial step in this discussion is assessing criteria to reduce eutrophication back to a level acceptable to both humans and nature.},

   abstract = {Microphytobenthos is potentially highly sensitive to environmental alterations, but has been rarely utilized in monitoring studies. Here we investigated the use of microphytobenthos colonizing Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) to assess the marine environmental quality. We analysed microphytobenthic assemblages in terms of abundance, biomass and species composition on ARMS deployed in northern Adriatic Sea along a gradient of increasing impacts. We show that microphytobenthic variables changed significantly across sites, with lowest abundance and biodiversity in the highly impacted site. Moreover, the specific analysis of Diatoms revealed that genera like Entomoneis and Cylindrotheca could be used as indicators of nutrient enriched and stressed conditions. We provide evidence that the analysis of microphytobenthos colonizing artificial substrates could be used as a tool for detecting altered environmental characteristics. We also show that the ARMS, recreating hot spots of microphytobenthic biodiversity, and protect them from grazing, could be potentially utilized to restore degraded hard substrates. Our result indicates that microphytobenthos can be easily incorporated in future monitoring and restoration programmes to assess and improve marine environmental health.},

   abstract = {Benthic diatoms isolated from tidal flats in the west coast of Korea were identified through both traditional morphological method and molecular phylogenetic method for methodological comparison. For the molecular phylogenetic analyses, we sequenced the 18S rRNA and the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit coding gene, rbcL. Further, the comparative analysis allowed for the assessment of the suitability as a genetic marker for identification of closely related benthic diatom species and as potential barcode gene. Based on the traditional morphological identification system, the 61 isolated strains were classified into 52 previously known taxa from 13 genera. However, 17 strains could not be classified as known species by morphological analyses, suggesting a hidden diversity of benthic diatoms. The Blast search on NCBI's Genebank indicated that the reference sequences for most of the species were absent for the benthic diatoms. Of the two genetic markers, the rbcL genes were more divergent than the 18S rRNA genes. Furthermore, a long branch attraction artefact was found in the 18S rRNA phylogeny. These results suggest that the rbcL gene is a more appropriate genetic marker for identification and classification of benthic diatoms. Considering their high diversity and simple shapes, and thus the difficulty associated with morphological classification of benthic diatoms, a molecular approach could provide a relatively easy and reliable classification system. However, this study suggests that more effort should be made to construct a reliable database containing polyphasic taxonomic data for diatom classification.},

   abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive (WFD), which was adopted in 2000, changed water management in all member states of the European Union fundamentally, putting aquatic ecology at the base of management decisions. Here we review the successes and problems encountered with implementation of the WFD over the past 10years and provide recommendations to further improve the implementation process. We particularly address three fields: (i) the development of assessment methods (including reference conditions, typologies and intercalibration); (ii) the implementation of assessment systems in monitoring programmes; and (iii) the consequences for river basin management plans (such as the design, monitoring and success of restoration measures). The development of assessment methods has been a transparent process and has resulted in improved and more standardised tools for assessing water bodies across Europe. The process has been more time consuming, and methods are more complex, than originally expected. Future challenges still remain, including the estimation of uncertainty of assessment results and a revision of rules in combining the results obtained with different Biological Quality Elements. A huge amount of monitoring data is now being generated for WFD purposes. Monitoring data are not centrally stored and thus poorly accessible for purposes beyond the WFD. Future challenges include enhanced data accessibility and the establishment of a Europe-wide central monitoring network of reference sites. The WFD river basin management plans base management decisions on the response of aquatic organisms to environmental stress. In contrast to the effects of degradation, the biotic response to restoration is less well-known and poorly predictable. The timescale of the WFD (obtaining good ecological status in all surface waters by 2027) is over-ambitious. Future challenges include long-term monitoring of restoration measures to understand the requirements for ecosystems to recover and prioritisation of measures according to re-colonisation potential.},

   abstract = {The muddy estuary of the River Colne, east coast UK, is hypernutrified, with strong gradients of NO3- and NH4+ up the estuary due to inputs from the river and sewage treatment works. There were no significant transformations of nitrogen detected in the water column. In the sandy sediment at the mouth of the estuary nitrification occurred with NO3- export from the sediment, but the muddy sediments higher up the estuary were large sinks for NO3- and major sites of denitrification. The flux of NO3- into the sediment at these sites was correlated with the water column NO3- concentration, and there was a large capacity for the sediments to respond to increases in the water column NO3- concentration. A seasonal cycle occurred with maximum denitrification during early winter, when water column NO3- was greatest and low temperatures favoured denitrification over NO3- ammonification. Highest unit area rates of denitrification were measured by acetylene inhibition at the uppermost site in the estuary, but when allowance was made for the area of sediment surface in each sector the middle reaches of the estuary were more significant to the estuarine nitrogen budget. Approximately 50% of the NO3- flux through the estuary was denitrified during 1993-1994. In addition, measurements of denitrification by the (NO3-)-N-15 isotope pairing technique suggested that coupled nitrification-denitrification within the sediment was also important, and when this was also allowed for the sediments removed by denitrification between 18 and 27 % of the total nitrogen flux through the estuary. There was some question, however, of whether the coupled nitrification-denitrification was overestimated if the anammox reaction was occurring in the highly organic, high NO3- sediments at the river end of the estuary. It is concluded that in these turbid, muddy estuaries the sediments are not only major attenuators of the flux of NO3-, but are also very effective traps for organically bound nitrogen. This suggests that the loads of nitrogen through these estuaries to the North Sea, which are usually derived from river gauging above the high tide mark, significantly overestimate the real load as they do not take into account attenuation of nitrogen flux within the estuary. While this attenuation may decrease the nitrogen loads, it implies that any environmental impact in coastal waters may be the result of much lower loads of nitrogen than hitherto assumed.},

We investigated the impact of a natural nematode assemblage on the biomass and microbial community structure of a multispecies diatom biofilm. Nematodes stimulated diatom biomass accumulation of the biofilm and caused a shift in diatom community structure. Higher diatom biomass accumulation in the presence of nematodes could be the result of increased diatom biomass production through nutrient regeneration resulting from grazing or bioturbation, and/or through shifts in interspecific interactions between diatoms (e.g. competition) through selective grazing. Alternatively, lower biomass in the controls may be due to higher secretion of diatom production in the form of bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Our observations underscore that meiobenthos, and especially nematodes, are important for the structure and production of tidal biofilms.},

   abstract = {Abstract Environmental programs in the United States face technical challenges that inhibit the ability to use diatoms in water quality monitoring and assessment projects. Specifically, inconsistent taxonomy can obscure diatom responses to environmental variables. Problems are the result of (1) limited access to a common set of taxonomic references, especially those that are geographically relevant, (2) inefficient enumeration protocols, (3) lack of complete and transparent documentation of taxa, and (4) limited opportunities for continued education, training, and knowledge sharing. However, robust resources and practices are available to improve diatom data quality and interpretation. Several resources improve diatom data quality, including a publicly accessible taxonomic reference (diatoms.org) and recommended practices. These practices include adoption of the voucher floras, random sample assignment, replicate microscope slides, and improved quality control. Finally, the Society for Freshwater Science Diatom Taxonomic Certification Committee is developing educational materials and certification exams to support practitioner training and to increase the diatom research knowledge base. The resources and practices in this article are broadly applicable to improving basic and applied research on diatoms worldwide.},

   abstract = {The Water Framework Directive requires the assessment of the ecological status of transitional waters considering the fish component. An original methodology, based on a pressure-impact approach, was established to develop a multimetric fish-based index to characterize the ecological quality of French estuaries. An index of contamination, based on the chemical pollution affecting aquatic systems, was used as a proxy of anthropogenic pressure. The fish metric selection was based on their response to disturbances tested via statistical models (generalized linear models) taking into account sampling strategy and estuarine features. Four metrics, for which discriminating responses to level of pressure were demonstrated, were retained to constitute the estuarine multimetric fish index.

It is of great interest, among the marine biologists and geneticists community, to shed light on the origin and evolutionary advantage of this variability of dimensions, geometries and pore distributions. In the present article the main reported data related to frustule morphogenesis and functionalities with contributions from fundamental biology, genetics, mathematics, geometry and physics are reviewed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana Prasad 1990 is a small centric diatom found in the plankton of water bodies with a wide range of salt concentrations. This paper describes the morphological features of the valve of C. choctawhatcheeana, from Alchichica lake, a hyposaline lake located in Central Mexico, and provides information about their ecology with respect to water chemistry and distribution in the water column along the annual cycle. Alchichica, and their neighbor lake Atexcac, are the only Mexican water bodies where C. choctawhatcheeana has been registered. RESULTS: Morphological differences were found with respect to the original description. The valves of C. choctawhatcheeana from Alchichica exceeded the diameter (5-12 microm) given for the type material (3.0-9.5 microm), and it does not forms or seldom forms short chains (2-3 cells) in contrast of up to 20 cell chains. Other difference was the presence of irregularly distributed small silica granules around the margin of the external view of the valve, meanwhile in Prasad's diagnosis a ring of siliceous granules is present near the valve margin; all other features were within the range of variation of the species. Maximum densities (up to 3877 cells ml(-1)) of C. choctawhatcheeana were found in Alchichica lake from June to October, along the stratificated period of the lake. Low densities (48 cells ml(-1)) when the water column was mixed, in January and February. C. choctawhatcheeana of Lake Alchichica was found in an ample depth range from 20 m down to 50 m. Conductivity (K25) ranged between 13.3 and 14.5 mS cm(-1) and the pH between 8.8 and 10.0. Water temperature fluctuated between 14.5 and 20 degrees C. Dissolved oxygen ranged from anoxic (non detectable) up to saturation (7 mg l(-1)). CONCLUSION: The morphology of C. choctawhatcheeana from Alchichica corresponded to the original description, with exception of some secondary traits. C. choctawhatcheeana can grow in several different environmental conditions. It can use nutrients along the water column during the mixing period in the lake. But when nutrients are scarce, C. choctawhatcheeana, can be located in very high densities, into a well defined depth layer of the lake, being an important contributor to the depth chlorophyll maximum (DCM). The species seems to be a small size but significant component of the phytoplankton in the saline Mexican lake Alchichica.},

   abstract = {Estuarine sediments are a reservoir for faecal bacteria, such as E. coli, where they reside at greater concentrations and for longer periods than in the overlying water. Faecal bacteria in sediments do not usually pose significant risk to human health until resuspended into the water column, where transmission routes to humans are facilitated. The erosion resistance and corresponding E. coli loading of intertidal estuarine sediments was monitored in two Scottish estuaries to identify sediments that posed a risk of resuspending large amounts of E. coli. In addition, models were constructed in an attempt to identify sediment characteristics leading to higher erosion resistance. Sediments that exhibited low erosion resistance and a high E. coli loading occurred in the upper- and mid-reaches of the estuaries where sediments had higher organic content and smaller particle sizes, and arose predominantly during winter and autumn, with some incidences during summer. Models using sediment characteristics explained 57.2% and 35.7% of sediment shear strength and surface stability variance respectively, with organic matter content and season being important factors for both. However large proportions of the variance remained unexplained. Sediments that posed a risk of resuspending high amounts of faecal bacteria could be characterised by season and sediment type, and this should be considered in the future modelling of bathing water quality.},

   abstract = {This chapter describes techniques used by diatomists to clean and mount diatoms successfully. The techniques involve the use of extremely hazardous chemicals that are a serious threat to one’s health and physical safety, including strong mineral acids that can cause severe skin burns or blindness after brief contact with the skin or eyes; sodium hydroxide, a strong base which can dissolve human tissue; strong oxidizing agents which can cause severe chemical burns; and organic solvents known to be carcinogenic, which can be absorbed through the skin or inhaled. The information presented here is to explain to the reader how diatomists process diatoms, but should not be considered to be suggestions, instructions, or directions for the reader. The reader is specifically warned not to perform any action with hazardous chemicals unless they have proper equipment to protect themselves. They should also have personal instruction and supervision from an experienced teacher who is present physically and able to supervise their actions, provide guidance, and to assume liability. Even when meeting these conditions, no diatom cleaning technique should be undertaken without precautions: wearing heavy, acid-resistant clothing and gloves; using head, face, and eye protection against chemical splashes; processing diatoms in the protection of a fume hood; and having materials nearby which can rapidly neutralize any spilled acids or bases, with readily- accessible first aid equipment for potential injuries. Any work with organic solvents should only be done with adequate ventilation and with vigorous attempts to minimize contact with the skin with the liquid solvent, and to minimize inhalation of solvent vapors. A reader taking any actions with hazardous chemicals will do so at their own risk, and will take full personal responsibility and liability for their own actions. The Author, the Editors, and Springer and its employees will not be responsible for any injuries, accidents, illnesses, or damages that might arise from the reader’s use of chemicals described here.},

Analysis of a 30 year data set (1981-2010) for the Colne estuary, a hypernutrified estuary in the south-east of England, revealed significant reductions in nutrient concentrations in freshwater inputs and along the estuarine gradient linked to management actions. DIN concentrations decreased, mainly as a result of reduced ammonia outputs from Colchester STW and reduced nitrate loads from the catchment. Declines in phosphate concentrations occurred due to improved STW processes. There were significant declines in phytoplankton chlorophyll a over the period. Long-term trajectories of nutrient decreases were also strongly influenced by interannual patterns of rainfall and climatic signals (winter NAO). Standardised winter DIN concentrations in the Colne estuary significantly exceed the Water Framework Directive good status target, but the estuary shows no symptoms of eutrophication.},

   abstract = {Despite the significance of diatoms in biomonitoring, many aspects of their biodiversity and geographical distribution are poorly understood. Recent evidence from molecular data has shown that traditional cosmopolitan and euryvalent morphospecies are often heterogeneous, containing cryptic or pseudo-cryptic species. It is important to establish whether these more finely differentiated species are also cosmopolitan or show restricted distributions. According to the standard freshwater diatom floras, Navicula cryptocephala and morphologically similar species (N. veneta, N. trivialis, N. gregaria and N. cryptotenella) are common, cosmopolitan freshwater pennate diatoms. Although allopatric and even sympatric populations of N. cryptocephala are extremely similar morphologically, they have previously been found to be highly polymorphic with respect to reproductive and nuclear characteristics; however, molecular data supporting the existence of cryptic diversity were lacking. Phylogenetic analyses (LSU rDNA, ITS of the rRNA operon) of 52 strains of N. cryptocephala-like diatoms confirmed the existence of genetically distinct lineages within N. cryptocephala, and revealed a close relationship between N. trivialis and N. cryptocephala. Cytological, reproductive and morphological variation, investigated by means of landmark-based geometric morphometrics, were in congruence with molecular data. Two pseudo-cryptic species within N. cryptocephala coexist sympatrically and are widely distributed, occurring in both European and Australian lakes.},

Overall, 75 diatoms, 98 ciliates, 16 DF, 3 PF and 34 HF species were identified; some are new records for the White Sea. Common species for each group are illustrated. Diatoms and ciliates showed high alpha-diversity (species richness per sample), whereas flagellates were characterized by high beta-diversity (species turnover across the intertidal flat). Each group demonstrated its own spatial pattern that was best matched with its own subset of abiotic variables, reflecting group-specific responses to environmental gradients. Species richness increased from the upper intertidal zone seaward for ciliates but decreased for HF, whereas autotrophs showed a relatively uniform pattern with a slight peak at the mid-intertidal zone. Across the littoral zone, all groups showed distinct compositional changes; however, the position of the boundary between "upper" and "lower" intertidal communities varied among groups. Most of the species found at Ryazhkov Island are known from many other regions worldwide, indicating a wide geographic distribution of microbial eukaryotic species.},

Another interest is in understanding the artistry of the amorphous silica shell and the underlying biomineralization process.

   abstract = {Micro-estuaries and micro-outlets are very small coastal systems that share some biotic and abiotic characteristics with larger temporarily closed estuaries, but differ in that the former have small localized catchments and limited connectivity with the marine environment. This multidisciplinary study reviews the first comprehensive investigation into the ecological structure of a subset of southern African micro-estuaries and micro-outlets, elucidating the biotic and abiotic components that characterize these systems. Furthermore, the microsystems (which have an open water area of less than 5ha and a depth of less than 1m) are compared with larger estuarine systems in the region, with the former representing one end of a continuum ranging from micro-outlets to large estuarine lakes and bays. In terms of the abiotic regime, the micro-outlets were dominated by oligohaline or freshwater conditions, while the micro-estuaries were mostly mesohaline. Relatively few freshwater-associated microalgae, zooplankton, macrozoobenthos and fish taxa were present in the micro-outlets, while a richer combination of freshwater and estuary-associated taxa dominated the micro-estuaries. Due to their small size and limited periods of abiotic stability, microsystems only serve as intermediate nursery areas for 0+ juveniles of estuary-associated marine fish which, after less than a year, migrate to nearby larger estuarine systems in order to complete their juvenile life stages. When compared to temporarily closed estuaries, predominantly open estuaries, estuarine lakes and estuarine bays, microsystems are depauperate in terms of typical estuarine and marine biota. However, further research is recommended on microsystems in southern Africa and globally, in order to define in greater detail their physico-chemical and biological characteristics.},

   abstract = {We examined the relationship between viruses and co-occurring bacterial communities across spatiotemporal scale in two contrasting freshwater lakes, namely meromictic Lake Pavin and dimictic Lake Aydat (Central France). Next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes suggested distinct patterns in bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) between the lakes over depths and seasons. BCC were generally dominated by members of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes covering about 95% of all sequences. Oxygen depletion at the bottom waters in Aydat and existence of permanent anoxia in the monimolimnion of Pavin resulted in the occurrence and dominance of lesser known members of lake communities such as Methylotenera, Methylobacter, Gallionella, Sulfurimonas, and Syntrophus in Pavin and Methylotenera and Sulfuritalea in Aydat. Differences in BCC appeared strongly related to dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, viral infection, and virus-to-bacteria ratio. UniFrac analysis indicated a clear distinction in BCC when the percentage of viral infected bacterial cells and virus-to-bacteria ratio exceeded a threshold level of 10% and 5, respectively, suggesting a link between viruses and their potential bacterial host communities. Our study revealed that in both the lakes, the prevailing environmental factors across time and space structured and influenced the adaptation of bacterial communities to specific ecological niches.},

Here, we assess the vulnerability of the North Water polynya, a unique seaice ecosystem that sustains the world's northernmost Inuit communities and several keystone Arctic species. We reconstruct mid-to-late Holocene changes in sea ice, marine primary production, and little auk colony dynamics through multi-proxy analysis of marine and lake sediment cores. Our results suggest a productive ecosystem by 4400-4200 cal yrs b2k coincident with the arrival of the first humans in Greenland. Climate forcing during the late Holocene, leading to periods of polynya instability and marine productivity decline, is strikingly coeval with the human abandonment of Greenland from c. 2200-1200 cal yrs b2k. Our long-term perspective highlights the future decline of the North Water ecosystem, due to climate warming and changing sea-ice conditions, as an important climate change risk.},

This study aimed to quantify and characterize plastic debris in oceanic surface waters of the Antarctic Peninsula. Sampling was done through surface trawls, and mean debris concentration was estimated at 1,794 items.km(-2) with an average weight of 27.8 g.km(-2). No statistical difference was found between the amount of mesoplastics (46%) and microplastics (54%). We found hard and flexible fragments, spheres and lines, in nine colors, composed mostly of polyurethane, polyamide, and polyethylene. An oceanographic dispersal model showed that, for at least seven years, sampled plastics likely did not originate from latitudes lower than 58 degrees S. Analysis of epiplastic community diversity revealed bacteria, microalgae, and invertebrate groups adhered to debris. Paint fragments were present at all sampling stations and were approximately 30 times more abundant than plastics. Although paint particles were not included in plastic concentration estimates, we highlight that they could have similar impacts as marine plastics. We call for urgent action to avoid and mitigate plastic and paint fragment inputs to the Southern Ocean.},

   abstract = {The increase in extreme events such as storms is one of the major threats that coastal ecosystems will have to face in the near future. In such a context, both maturation and ecological successions processes remain at the core of ecology to better anticipate the changes to ecosystem biodiversity and functions facing environmental stressors. However, these concepts are mainly approached through closed experimental studies that oversimplify the mechanisms. A survey was carried out on a 'natural' and open ecosystem subjected to an acute disturbance, i.e. a marine submersion of freshwater drained marshes, occurring after a storm. Plankton biomass, production and taxonomic/functional phytoplankton diversity were followed weekly at four stations over 2 months. Most of the stations were disrupted by this acute disturbance and displayed gradual growth and development, as described in the classical maturation process. The main differences between stations were attributed to the heterogeneity of the communities before the storm, the intensity of the disturbance and the different human actions performed to recover the freshwater environment. The concept of 'ecological resilience' was thus better suited than 'engineering resilience' for such open systems facing constant fluctuations in environmental drivers. With regard to ecological succession, the more impacted stations were marked by a significant change in taxonomic beta-diversity, with numerous stochastic processes, due to taxa dispersion. They first exhibited a convergence in functional traits due to the increase in nutrient availability drained from the catchment basin and then an increase in divergence when nutrients became limited.},

Herbicides can have toxic effects on freshwater benthic diatoms, the base of the aquatic food web. We examined the effects of (non-mixture) herbicide exposure to the health of diatoms for eight common herbicides with three different modes of action; the photosystem II (PSII) inhibitors: atrazine, simazine, hexazinone, tebuthiuron and diuron; two auxinic herbicides: MCPA and 2,4-D; and the EPSP synthase inhibitor: glyphosate. Benthic diatoms within riverine communities were exposed to each herbicide in rapid toxicity tests at concentrations of 50, 200 and 500mugL(-1). The most sensitive taxa were Gomphonema spp. and Encyonema gracilis. Navicula cryptotenella was the most tolerant to herbicide exposure. There was no significant effect of the different herbicide modes of action at the community level. Herbicide mode of action did not alter which taxa were most sensitive within the community and sensitivity rankings of the dominant diatom taxa were similar for each of the eight herbicides. The consistency of the results between herbicides suggests that freshwater benthic diatoms may be suitable in situ indicators for detecting the toxicity of herbicides with differing modes of action.},

   abstract = {A mechanistic and biogeochemical model was developed to analyze the interactions between microphytobenthos (MPB), bacteria and nutrients in a tidal system. Behavioral vertical migration was hypothesized as being controlled by exogenous factors (tide and light) but also by endogenous factors (carbon and nitrogen requirements). The secretion of Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) during photosynthesis (overflow metabolism) and migration of diatoms was also formulated. Similarities in MPB dynamics between observations and simulations support the assumption that carbon and nitrogen ratios are additional key processes behind the vertical migration of diatoms in the sediment. The model satisfactorily reproduced the three growth phases of the MPB development observed in a mesocosm (the lag phase, the logarithmic growth, and the plateau). Besides, nutrient availability, which could be induced by faunal bioturbation, significantly determined the extent of MPB biomass and development. The plateau phase observed in the last days of simulations appeared to be attributed to a nutrient depletion in the system, emphasizing the importance of nutrient availability. The model, although improvable especially on the formulation of the EPS excretion and bacteria development, already updated understanding of several aspects of benthic-system functioning during experimental conditions.},

Here we describe the new genus Ambo, in an attempt to clarify some of the polyphyly of taxa with internal costa by formally transferring Anaulus balticus, Anaulus simonsenii, and Plagiogramma tenuissimum as well as Ambo gallaeciae, described here. Related to this, we attempt to document and characterize the genus Anaulus itself, which was formally described by Ehrenberg with an illustration. A search by LM of mica designated by Ehrenberg as the holotype of Anaulus scalaris, the generitype of Anaulus, failed to recover a specimen which adequately describes the genus to the exclusion of other genera with internal costa. We also present morphological and molecular data for Anaulus creticus and suggest a new genus-Ceratanaulus-to reflect the distinct morphological and molecular characters we documented.},

   abstract = {Coastal waters are expected to undergo severe warming in the coming decades. Very little is known about how diatoms, the dominant primary producers in these habitats, will cope with these changes. We investigated the thermal niche of Cylindrotheca closterium, a widespread benthic marine diatom, using 24 strains collected over a wide latitudinal gradient. A multi-marker phylogeny in combination with a species delimitation approach shows that C. closterium represents a (pseudo)cryptic species complex, and this is reflected in distinct growth response patterns in terms of optimum growth temperature, maximum growth rate, and thermal niche width. Strains from the same clade displayed a similar thermal response, suggesting niche conservation between closely related strains. Due to their lower maximum growth rate and smaller thermal niche width, we expect the polar species to be particularly sensitive to warming, and, in the absence of adaptation, to be replaced with species from lower latitudes.},

   abstract = {Modern microbial mats and biofilms play a paramount role in sediment biostabilization. When sporadic storms affect tidal flats of Bahia Blanca Estuary, the underlying siliciclastic sediment is exposed by physical disruption of the mat, and in a few weeks' lapse, a microbial community re-establishes. With the objective of studying colonization patterns and the ecological succession of microorganisms at the scale of these erosional structures, these were experimentally made and their biological recolonization followed for 8 weeks, with replication in winter and spring. Motile pennate diatoms led the initial colonization following two distinct patterns: a dominance by Cylindrotheca closterium in winter and by naviculoid and nitzschioid diatoms in spring. During the first 7 days, cell numbers increased 2- to 17-fold. Cell densities further increased exhibiting sigmoidal community growth, reaching 2.9-8.9 x 106 cells cm-3 maxima around day 30; centric diatoms maintained low densities throughout. In 56 days after removal of the original mat, filamentous cyanobacteria that dominate mature mats did not establish a significant biomass, leading to the rejection of the hypothesis that cyanobacteria would drive the colonization. The observed dominance of pennate diatoms is attributed to extrinsic factors determined by tidal flooding, and intrinsic ones, e.g. motility, nutrient affinity and high growth rate.},

   abstract = {The effects of multiple stressors on marine diatom assemblages are still poorly understood. The interactive effects of metals and nutrients were assessed in two coastal biofilms grown at a reference site and a historically contaminated site. The biofilms were exposed in situ to pulse exposures of metals (Zn and Pb) and nutrients (N and P) individually and in combination to mimic patterns of discharge in the study area. The reference community's structure (composition and abundance of taxa) was modified after metals and/or nutrients exposure, but each stressor acted in different way. Irrespective of the stressors or scenario, the abundance of the dominant species Opephora krumbeinii declined, and it is proposed as sensitive species. Nutrient supply favoured the proliferation of certain species with high nutrient tolerances (Fragilaria famelica, Tabularia ktenoeides), whereas metals promoted the colonisation of metal-tolerant species, e.g., Berkeleya fennica, Opephora marina. Simultaneous exposure induced an amplification of levels of accumulated metals, chlorophyll a and EPS contents and triggered the succession of species towards tolerant species with specific growth. Metals seemed to act as a selective factor of metal-tolerant species, and nutrients favoured the proliferation of those species forming zig-zag colonies (Neosynedra provincialis), mucous tubes (Berkeleya spp.) and motile diatoms (Navicula salinicola, Nitzschia incognita), resulting in biofilms with a more complex architecture. The diatom communities from the historically contaminated site were more resistant to pulse exposure, but metals or nutrients loads induced overproduction of mucilage. We propose that growth forms may complement taxonomic approaches and provide a quick and easy way to detect community changes related to metal and nutrient pollution.},

   abstract = {This opinion paper introduces a special series of articles dedicated to freshwater benthic algae and their use in assessment and monitoring. This special series was inspired by talks presented at the 9th International Congress on the Use of Algae for Monitoring Rivers and Comparable Habitats (Trento, Italy, 2015), the latest of a series of meetings started in 1991. In this paper, we will first provide a brief overview of phytobenthos methods in Europe. Then, we will turn towards the 'dark side' of phytobenthos and describe four particular problems for phytobenthos assessment in the European Union: (1) over-reliance on a single group of algae (mostly diatoms) to the exclusion of other groups; (2) relatively low adoption of benthic algae for ecological assessments in lakes; (3) absence of measures of phytobenthos abundance; (4) approaches used to define boundaries between ecological classes. Following this, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of current phytobenthos assessment methods against 12 criteria for method evaluation addressing four areas: ecological rationale, performance, feasibility of implementation, and use in communication and management. Using these criteria, we identify and discuss three general challenges for those developing new methods for phytobenthos-based assessment: a weak ecological rationale and insufficient consideration of the role of phytobenthos as a diagnostic tool and for communicating ecosystem health beyond a narrow group of specialists. The papers in the special series allow a comparison with the situation and approaches in the USA, present new methods for the assessment of ecological status and acidification, provide tools for an improved management of headwaters and petrifying springs, discuss the utility of phytobenthos for lake assessments, and test the utility of functional measures (such as biofilm phosphorus uptake capacity, PUC).},

   abstract = {The earliest known diatom fossils with well-preserved siliceous frustules are from Lower Cretaceous neritic marine deposits in Antarctica. In this study, we analyzed the cell wall structure to establish whether their cell and life cycles were similar to modern forms. At least two filamentous species (Basilicostephanus ornatus and Archepyrgus melosiroides) had girdle band structures that functioned during cell division in a similar way to present day Aulacoseira species. Also, size analyses of cell diameter indicated that the cyclic process of size decline and size restoration used to time modern diatom life cycles was present in five species from the Lower Cretaceous (B. ornatus, A. melosiroides, Gladius antiquus, Ancylopyrgus reticulatus, Kreagra forfex) as well as two species from Upper Cretaceous deposits (Trinacria anissimowii and Eunotogramma fueloepi) from the Southwest Pacific. The results indicate that the "Diatom Sex Clock" was present from an early evolutionary stage. Other ecological adaptations included changes in mantle height and coiling. Overall, the results suggest that at least some of the species in these early assemblages are on a direct ancestral line to modern forms.},

@book{Julius2010,
   abstract = {IntroductionDiatoms have long been lauded for their use as powerful and reliable environmental indicators (Cholnoky, 1968; Lowe, 1974). This utility can be attributed to their high abundance and species diversity, which are distributed among most aquatic environments. Additionally, their remains are highly durable and well preserved in accumulated sediments. Often, scientists exploiting the group simply as environmental proxies give little thought as to how and why the species diversity exists in these environments. This may be a by-product of how diatoms are collected and identified. Diatoms are most often recognized by the presence of a siliceous cell wall, the frustule. This structure varies considerably in shape and architecture among species (Figure 2.1) and virtually all taxonomic diagnosis of taxa is based upon frustular morphology. To properly observe diatom frustules for taxonomic identification, living and sedimentary collections are typically subjected to various “cleaning” techniques designed to remove all organic materials (e.g. Battarbee et al., 2001; Blanco et al., 2008), allowing unobstructed observation of the frustule in the microscope. This frequent observation of inorganic components of the cell without reference to the organic features allows observers to “forget” that the specimens seen in the microscope represent individual organisms competing in the selective environments driven by biotic and abiotic ecological pressures. The abundance and taxonomic diversity can be attributed to the extraordinary success of diatoms in the competitive ecological arena.The casual observer frequently regards diatoms, like most protists, as primitive ancestral lineages to multicellular organisms. While some protists may fit this description, diatoms do not. Diatoms are a relatively recent evolutionary group with the common ancestor’s origin considered to be between 200 and 190 million years before present (Rothpletz, 1896, 1900; Medlin et al., 1997).},

Diel changes in primary production and vertical migration are entrained by external factors like photoperiod and tides. However, the role of photoperiod and tides has not been experimentally separated to date. Here, we performed laboratory experiments with sediment cores kept in immersion, in the absence of tides, with photoperiod or under continuous light. Measurements of net production, made with O2 microsensors, and of spectral reflectance at the sediment surface showed that, in intertidal sediments, the photoperiod signal was the major driver of the diel patterns of net primary production and sediment oxygen availability through the vertical migration of the MPB photoautotrophic biomass. Vertical migration was controlled by an endogenous circadian rhythm entrained by photoperiod in the absence of tides. The pattern progressively disappeared after 3 days in continuous light but was immediately reset by photoperiod. Even though a potential contribution of a subjective in situ tidal signal cannot be completely discarded, Fourier and cross spectral analysis of temporal patterns indicated that the photosynthetic circadian rhythm was mainly characterized by light/dark migratory cycles.},

However, determining the factors that regulate the seasonal changes of MPB and its distribution patterns at larger scales is hindered by the considerable spatial and temporal variability in these environments. Here, we studied the dynamics of intertidal MPB biomass, cover, and net growth rates in a south European tidal flat (Cadiz Bay, Spain) over a four-year period using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Pixels dominated by different benthic communities (MPB, Zostera sp., Caulerpa sp. and green macroalgae) were identified at a 10-m resolution using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning classification algorithm. MPB dominated the intertidal zone. MPB cover did not show a clear seasonal pattern and was clearly higher in the middle of the intertidal range of sea level. Despite interannual variability, MPB biomass was always higher during winter, coinciding with observations from other low latitude intertidal flats with temperate climate, and in the upper-middle intertidal. Net rates of MPB biomass change, calculated from the differences in MPB NDVI over time, showed maximal net growth rates from autumn to winter and maximum loss rates during spring and summer, although with high variability. Our study demonstrates that RF algorithms allow mapping MPB and other intertidal communities from Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery accurately obtaining invaluable information from large areas at very high spatio-temporal resolution. The dissimilarities observed in the patterns of MPB variables over time or sea level, indicate differences in their ecological regulation, still largely unknown both here and in other temperate climate intertidal flats. High resolution remote sensing can aid in their detailed and systematic study producing a more integrated view of these systems and contributing to their science-based management and conservation.},

   abstract = {Seagrass meadows are monitored in the frame of several environmental programs worldwide, including the Water Framework Directive (WFD), to evaluate the ecological status of European coastal and transitional water bodies. The large size, spatial complexity, and interannual variability of seagrass ecosystems significantly challenge field monitoring. In this study, a multi-mission satellite time-series was used to estimate long-term changes in seagrass status in a macrotidal system dominated by Zostera noltei, at Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast). Metrics of seagrass extent and density were obtained from Earth Observation (EO) using validated and inter-calibrated Landsat, SPOT and Sentinel2 data from 1985 to 2020. The information provided by satellite data made it possible to compute and compare several seagrass indicators currently in use in several European countries (France, Portugal and UK) within the WFD. Both the seagrass extent and meadow-averaged density displayed increasing trends since 1985. A time-series of merged observations from various satellites revealed a high degree of interannual variability in seagrass extent, with abrupt losses (up to 50% within one year) alternating with periods of slow recovery (typically 4–6 years). The seagrass meadow which was in a moderate status (sensu the WFD) in the 1980s, achieved an overall recurrent good or high status since the mid-1990s. Altogether, the methods and results presented here demonstrated that EO is a reliable source of information for mapping and assessing the status of intertidal seagrass, complementing in situ measurements by providing long-term, spatial view and standardized observation framework. We recommend the systematic use of EO time-series in complement to traditional field measurements in seagrass monitoring programs such as the WFD.},

   abstract = {In temperate coastal regions of Western Europe, the polychaete Sabellaria alveolata (Linn&eacute;) builds large intertidal reefs of several hectares on soft-bottom substrates. These reefs are protected by the European Habitat Directive EEC/92/43 under the status of biogenic structures hosting a high biodiversity and providing ecological functions such as protection against coastal erosion. As an alternative to time-consuming field campaigns, a UAV-based Structure-from-Motion photogrammetric survey was carried out in October 2020 over Noirmoutier Island (France) where the second-largest known European reef is located in a tidal delta. A DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral UAV provided a topographic dataset at very high resolutions of 5 cm/pixel for the Digital Surface Model (DSM) and 2.63 cm/pixel for the multispectral orthomosaic images. The reef footprint was mapped using a combination of two topographic indices: the Topographic Openness Index and the Topographic Position Index. The reef structures covered an area of 8.15 ha, with 89% corresponding to the main reef composed of connected and continuous biogenic structures, 7.6% of large isolated structures (&lt;60 m2), and 4.4% of small isolated reef clumps (&lt;2 m2). To further describe the topographic complexity of the reef, the Geomorphon landform classification was used. The spatial distribution of tabular platforms considered as a healthy stage of the reef in contrast to a degraded stage was mapped with a proxy that consists in comparing the reef volume to a theoretical tabular-shaped reef volume. Epibionts colonizing the reef (macroalgae, mussels, and oysters) were also mapped by combining multispectral indices such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and simple band ratios with topographic indices. A confusion matrix showed that macroalgae and mussels were satisfactorily identified but that oysters could not be detected by an automated procedure due to their spectral complexity. The topographic indices used in this work should now be further exploited to propose a health index for these large intertidal reefs.},

   abstract = {This work describes a new method for assessing the ecological quality of intertidal seagrass in estuaries and coastal systems, the Seagrass Quality Index (SQI). The design of the SQI aims to fulfil the Water Framework Directive requirements in terms of compliance (e.g., metrics, sampling procedure, pressure relationship, uncertainty of misclassification and comparability to other methodologies in terms of concept). The index includes three common and easy-to-measure structural parameters of seagrass (i.e., the no. of taxa, bed extent and shoot density) combined in a calculation rule that allows the index to report all five of the quality classes (i.e., high, good, moderate, poor and bad). The present study contains analyses of the relationships between the ecosystem-quality results produced by the index and the pressures measured in the system as well as the relationships between the SQI and the seagrass parameters composing it (both the correlation between the SQI and metrics and the SQI sensitivity to the individual variation of each metric). These relationships were tested using a Spearman rank-correlation analysis, producing significant correlations between the biological metrics and the index results as well as between the index results and the environmental quality-pressure category (i.e., the concentration of winter DIN and turbidity). In terms of management, it is possible to apply the methodology on a broad geographical scale in systems where the reference condition for the number of taxa is even higher than one (for the Mondego studied here, the reference value was one species). The tool fulfilled the WFD requirements, had a robust sampling design and proved to be able to track the inertia that usually exists from the moment the pressure is alleviated as well as the biological response that characterises the recovery phase in systems under restoration.},

   abstract = {Sabellaria alveolata is a sedentary gregarious tube-building species widely distributed from southwest Scotland to Morocco. This species builds what are currently considered the largest European biogenic reefs in the bay of Mont-Saint-Michel (France). As an ecosystem engineer, S. alveolata generates small to large scale topographic complexity, creating numerous spatial and trophic niches for other species to colonize. Sabellaria reefs are also under anthropogenic pressures, leading locally to massive degradation. However, stakeholders lack spatially explicit measures of reef ecological status, at adapted spatial resolution to provide key management information for this protected habitat. Traditional field surveys are extremely time-consuming and rely on expertise for visual ecological status assessment. The present study aims at using an automatic processing approach based on optical airborne data to (i) assess the potential of hyperspectral imagery to discriminate Sabellaria bioconstructions and its main ecosystem associated habitats, including different types of substrate as well as biological components and (ii) to use the combination of the hyperspectral and LiDAR signals to estimate the spatial structure of the different bioconstruction types (veneers vs. hummocks and platforms) and ecological phases (retrograding and prograding). A reef from Mont-Saint-Michel was used as a test site. We built a processing chain based on supervised classification using the Mahalanobis distance to generate an accurate distribution map (overall accuracy of 88% and a Kappa of 0.85) of 10 Sabellaria-related benthic features, including large reef developing on sand and smaller veneers encrusting rocky shore areas. Specific spectral indices were used to define the spatial distribution of the main primary producers, in particular the microphytobenthos. Joining the hyperspectral and LiDAR data led characterizing the distribution of S. alvealata’s ecological status (prograding and retrograding phases) with an overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient that can respectively amount to up to 93 and 0.86. In our study site, the Sabellaria reef area (between 5.52 and 6.76 ha) was dominated by retrograding phases (between 53 and 58%). Our results showed that this automatic processing chain could be relevant for the spatial characterization of other Sabellaria reef sites. Study perspectives tend toward a quantitative estimation of their ecological status index.},

   abstract = {Quantitative analysis of coastal marine benthic communities enables to adequately estimate the state of coastal marine environment, provide better evidence for environmental changes and describe processes that are conditioned by anthropogenic forces. Remote sensing could provide a tool for mapping bottom vegetation if the substrates are spectrally resolvable. We measured reflectance spectra of green (Cladophora glomerata), red (Furcellaria lumbricalis), and brown (Fucus vesiculosus) macroalgae and used a bio-optical model in estimating whether these algae distinguish optically from each other, from sandy bottom or deep water in turbid water conditions of the Baltic Sea. The simulation was carried out for three different water types: (1) CDOM-rich coastal water, (2) coastal waters not directly impacted by high CDOM discharge from rivers but with high concentration of cyanobacteria, (3) open Baltic waters. Our modelling results indicate that the reflectance spectra of C. glomerata, F. lumbricalis, F. vesiculosus differ from each other and also from sand and deep water reflectance spectra. The differences are detectable by remote sensing instruments at spectral resolution of 10 nm and SNR better than 1000:1. Thus, the lowest depth limits where the studied macroalgae grow do not exceed the depth where such remote sensing instruments could potentially detect the spectral differences between the studied species. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Seagrass mapping and monitoring using remote sensing has been established using various imageries and mapping methods, ranging from complex optical modeling to manual interpretations. Few attempts have been made to find relations between spatiotemporal changes within seagrass habitats and their surrounding environment in the mapping efforts. In this study, issues of spatiotemporal changes in seagrass habitat including water quality, and causes and processes of seagrass degradation were addressed through assessing the ability of integrated manual enhancement and seed pixel growing techniques on multi-date Landsat images for mapping and monitoring seagrass resources. This integrated approach was tested on a total of forty-nine Landsat 5, 7 and 8 images of the seagrass meadow spatial distribution and cover change analysis for Punag-Sari estuary (Lawas), Pengkalan Nangka (Kelantan) lagoon, and Paka (Terengganu) lagoon of Malaysia. The resulted maps demonstrated the ability of Landsat images for producing spatially extensive maps and allowed quantitative estimation of seagrass coverage, accretion/erosion, and describe changes in noticeable areas. The findings indicated that a noticeable loss of seagrass habitats at varying magnitude occurred between 2000 and 2014 for Punang-Sari, between 1998 and 2014 for Pegkalan Nangka, and between 1988 and 2014 for Paka. The natural event mainly sand shifting was the main cause of seagrass habitat loss for Punang-Sari Lawas. Coastline change was identified as the most significant factor that caused seagrass spatial cover loss of the Pengkalan Nangka lagoon. The seagrass meadows of Pengkalan Nangka and Paka were greatly affected by natural events including floods, and local human-induced interferences such as dredging, and sand mining. The mapping approach and the map products presented in this paper will be a useful information source for the coastal management agencies involved in monitoring and management programs.},

Knowledge of community structure is essential to understanding many reef processes. To develop techniques for identification and mapping of reef bottom-types using remote sensing, we measured 13,100 in situ optical reflectance spectra (400-700 nm, 1-nm intervals) of 12 basic reef bottom-types in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans: fleshy (1) brown, (2) green, and (3) red algae; non-fleshy (4) encrusting calcareous and (5) turf algae; (6) bleached, (7) blue, and (8) brown hermatypic coral; (9) soft/gorgonian coral; (10) seagrass; (11) terrigenous mud; and (12) carbonate sand. Each bottom-type exhibits characteristic spectral reflectance features that are conservative across biogeographic regions. Most notable are the brightness of carbonate sand and local extrema near 570 nm in blue (minimum) and brown (maximum) corals. Classification function analyses for the 12 bottom-types achieve mean accuracies of 83%, 76%, and 71% for full-spectrum data (301-wavelength), 52-wavelength, and 14-wavelength subsets, respectively. The distinguishing spectral features for the 12 bottom-types exist in well-defined, narrow (10-20 nm) wavelength ranges and are ubiquitous throughout the world. We reason that spectral reflectance features arise primarily as a result of spectral absorption processes. Radiative transfer modeling shows that in typically clear coral reef waters, dark substrates such as corals have a depth-of-detection limit on the order of 10-20 m. Our results provide the foundation for design of a sensor with the purpose of assessing the global status of coral reefs.},

Juvenile coral reef fish often inhabit mangroves2,3,4,5, but the importance of these nurseries to reef fish population dynamics has not been quantified. Indeed, mangroves might be expected to have negligible influence on reef fish communities: juvenile fish can inhabit alternative habitats and fish populations may be regulated by other limiting factors such as larval supply or fishing6. Here we show that mangroves are unexpectedly important, serving as an intermediate nursery habitat that may increase the survivorship of young fish. Mangroves in the Caribbean strongly influence the community structure of fish on neighbouring coral reefs. In addition, the biomass of several commercially important species is more than doubled when adult habitat is connected to mangroves. The largest herbivorous fish in the Atlantic, Scarus guacamaia, has a functional dependency on mangroves and has suffered local extinction after mangrove removal. Current rates of mangrove deforestation are likely to have severe deleterious consequences for the ecosystem function, fisheries productivity and resilience of reefs. Conservation efforts should protect connected corridors of mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs.},

Monitoring by field surveys provides accurate data but at highly localised scales and so is not cost-effective for reef scale monitoring at frequent time points. Remote sensing from satellites is an alternative and complementary approach. While remote sensing cannot provide the level of detail and accuracy at a single point than a field survey, the statistical power for inferring large scale patterns benefits in having complete areal coverage. This review considers the state of the art of coral reef remote sensing for the diverse range of objectives relevant for management, ranging from the composition of the reef: physical extent, benthic cover, bathymetry, rugosity; to environmental parameters: sea surface temperature, exposure, light, carbonate chemistry. In addition to updating previous reviews, here we also consider the capability to go beyond basic maps of habitats or environmental variables, to discuss concepts highly relevant to stakeholders, policy makers and public communication: such as biodiversity, environmental threat and ecosystem services. A clear conclusion of the review is that advances in both sensor technology and processing algorithms continue to drive forward remote sensing capability for coral reef mapping, particularly with respect to spatial resolution of maps, and synthesis across multiple data products. Both trends can be expected to continue.},

   abstract = {Sustained observations of marine biodiversity and ecosystems focused on specific conservation and management problems are needed around the world to effectively mitigate or manage changes resulting from anthropogenic pressures. These observations, while complex and expensive, are required by the international scientific, governance and policy communities to provide baselines against which the effects of human pressures and climate change may be measured and reported, and resources allocated to implement solutions. To identify biological and ecological essential ocean variables (EOVs) for implementation within a global ocean observing system that is relevant for science, informs society, and technologically feasible, we used a driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) model. We (1) examined relevant international agreements to identify societal drivers and pressures on marine resources and ecosystems, (2) evaluated the temporal and spatial scales of variables measured by 100+ observing programs, and (3) analysed the impact and scalability of these variables and how they contribute to address societal and scientific issues. EOVs were related to the status of ecosystem components (phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and diversity, and abundance and distribution of fish, marine turtles, birds and mammals), and to the extent and health of ecosystems (cover and composition of hard coral, seagrass, mangrove and macroalgal canopy). Benthic invertebrate abundance and distribution and microbe diversity and biomass were identified as emerging EOVs to be developed based on emerging requirements and new technologies. The temporal scale at which any shifts in biological systems will be detected will vary across the EOVs, the properties being monitored and the length of the existing time-series. Global implementation to deliver useful products will require collaboration of the scientific and policy sectors and a significant commitment to improve human and infrastructure capacity across the globe, including the development of new, more automated observing technologies, and encouraging the application of international standards and best practices.},

   abstract = {Although spectral vegetation indices (VIs) have been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation in general, such indices have been traditionally targeted at terrestrial, more than aquatic, vegetation. This study introduces two new VIs specifically targeted at aquatic vegetation: NDAVI and WAVI and assesses their performance in capturing information about aquatic vegetation features by comparison with pre-existing indices: NDVI, SAVI and EVI. The assessment methodology is based on: (i) theoretical radiative transfer modeling of vegetation canopy-backgrounds coupling, and (ii) spectral linear mixture simulation based on real-case endmembers. Two study areas, Lake Garda and Lakes of Mantua, in Northern Italy, and a multisensor dataset have been exploited for our study. Our results demonstrate the advantages of the new indices. In particular, NDAVI and WAVI sensitivity scores to LAI and LIDF parameters were generally higher than pre-existing indices' ones. Radiative transfer modeling and real-case based linear mixture simulation showed a general positive, non-linear correlation of vegetation indices with increasing LAI and vegetation fractional cover (FC), more marked for NDVI and NDAVI. Moreover, NDAVI and WAVI show enhanced capabilities in separating terrestrial from aquatic vegetation response, compared to pre-existing indices, especially of NDVI. The new indices provide good performance in distinguishing aquatic from terrestrial vegetation: NDAVI over low density vegetation (LAI < 0.7-1.0, FC < 40-50%), and WAVI over medium-high density vegetation (LAI > 1.0, FC > 50%). Specific vegetation indices can therefore improve remote sensing applications for aquatic vegetation monitoring. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Phragmites australis populations in native areas have been gradually declining since the mid-20th century. We developed a logical approach based on remote sensing to monitor the conservation status of P. australis beds in response to environmental gradients and orient future management actions in Lake Garda (northern Italy). During the 2010 growing season we collected data on: (i) the structural and functional status of seven P. australis beds and (ii) land cover in a 50-m buffer around each bed, and we tested four different vegetation indices (VIs) derived from a multi-temporal and multisensor dataset. Double hierarchical clustering based on the VI statistics and environmental variables (morphological, functional and land-use) showed a good consistency between the outputs of the vigor-function analysis and the environmental classification of the P. australis beds considered. Overall, the bed's area was the most influential factor in the data clustering procedures, followed by the descriptors derived from the enhanced vegetation index. Our results confirmed the importance of temporal characteristics of remote sensing data to assess the conservation status of common reed beds and proved the sensitivity of VIs and derived descriptors to local environmental conditions within a homogeneous littoral area. This study supports the utility of remote sensing for monitoring riparian vegetation and analyzing the spatial and temporal response of P. australis populations to human pressure and management actions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

   abstract = {Seagrasses are marine plants ranked worldwide amongst the most valuable coastal ecosystems. The global conservation effort requires accurate estimation of seagrass abundance and taxonomic composition. Hyperspectral reflectance has been used to estimate seagrass biomass, despite requiring destructive laboratory measurements that goes against conservation principles. Therefore, we assessed the efficiency of Zostera noltei hyperspectral reflectance to estimate its aboveground biomass in intertidal areas, having Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal) as a case study, with seasonal samplings during a whole year comparing (non-destructive) field- and (destructive) laboratory-based measurements of the spectral signature. Several vegetation indices (VIs) that focus on the spectral absorption of specific pigments were also tested: Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI)-like ratios, Double Difference (DD)-like Ratios and Simple Ratios (SR). Here we show that Z. noltei hyperspectral signature, measured in the field and in the laboratory, is clearly related to the aboveground biomass of the plant along the year. We found that among the VIs, NDVI-like ratios showed higher correlation with Z. noltei aboveground biomass than the other types of VIs. Taking into consideration the sensitivity to biomass saturation, the NDVI705 was identified as the best vegetation index to estimate Z. noltei biomass during the whole year and in both type of measurements, up to a saturation level, also demonstrating the successful use of non-destructive methods. The suitability of hyperspectral reflectance measurements in order to estimate Z. noltei aboveground biomass was confirmed, confirming also the potential efficient use of field-based measurements (non-destructive) for conservation practices and sustainable management of the species in intertidal ecosystems and allowing aboveground biomass to be potentially proposed as a metric for the evaluation of seagrass healthy condition under EU policies (e.g. Water Framework Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive).},

Benthic diatoms (i.e., phytobenthos) are one of the most common biological quality elements (BQEs) used in surface water monitoring and are particularly successful in detecting eutrophication, organic pollution and acidification. Herein, we reviewed their implementation in river biomonitoring for the purposes of the WFD, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages over other BQEs, and we discuss recent advances that could be applied in future biomonitoring. Until now, phytobenthos have been intercalibrated by the vast majority (26 out of 28) of EU Member States (MS) in 54% of the total water bodies assessed and was the most commonly used BQE after benthic invertebrates (85% of water bodies), followed by fish (53%), macrophytes (27%) and phytoplankton (4%). To meet the WFD demands, numerous taxonomy-based quality indices have been developed among MS, presenting, however, uncertainties possibly related to species biogeography. Recent development of different types of quality indices (trait-based, DNA sequencing and predictive modeling) could provide more accurate results in biomonitoring, but should be validated and intercalibrated among MS before their wide application in water quality assessments.},

   abstract = {1. The distribution patterns of unicellular and multicellular organisms have recently been shown to differ profoundly, with the former probably being mostly cosmopolitan, whereas the latter are mostly restricted to certain regions. However, the within-region distribution patterns of these two organism groups may be rather similar. 2. We predicted that the degree of regional occupancy in unicellular eukaryotes would be related to niche characteristics, dispersal ability and size, as has been found previously for multicellular organisms. The niche characteristics we considered were niche position, that measures marginality in species habitat distribution, and niche breadth, that measures amplitude in species habitat distribution. Niche characteristics were determined using Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis. 3. We found that the regional occupancy in our model group of unicellular eukaryotes, stream diatoms, was primarily a reflection of the niche position of a species or, more generally, habitat availability. Thus, non-marginal species (i.e. species that occupied common habitat conditions across the region) tended to be more widely distributed than marginal species (i.e. species that were restricted to a limited range of rare habitat conditions). This finding was further supported by the general linear model, with niche position, niche breadth, maximum size and attachment mode as explanatory variables: niche position was by far the most important variable accounting for variability in regional occupancy, with significant amounts of additional variation related to niche breadth and maximum size of diatoms. 4. Thus, the degree of regional occupancy among unicellular eukaryotes may be primarily governed by habitat availability, supporting former findings for multicellular organisms. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Our ability to separate the effects of these two biogeographic controls is limited by the enormous environmental variability both in space and through time. To circumvent this limitation, we analyzed fossil diatom assemblages over the past ̃1.5 million years from the world oceans and show that these eukaryotic microbes are not limited by dispersal. The lack of dispersal limitation in marine diatoms suggests that the biodiversity at the microbial level fundamentally differs from that of macroscopic animals and plants for which geographic isolation is a common component of speciation.},

   abstract = {Niche conservatism, the tendency of a species niche to remain unchanged over time, is often assumed when discussing, explaining or predicting biogeographical patterns. Unfortunately, there has been no basis for predicting niche dynamics over relevant timescales, from tens to a few hundreds of years. The recent application of species distribution models (SDMs) and phylogenetic methods to analysis of niche characteristics has provided insight to niche dynamics. Niche shifts and conservatism have both occurred within the last 100 years, with recent speciation events, and deep within clades of species. There is increasing evidence that coordinated application of these methods can help to identify species which likely fulfill one key assumption in the predictive application of SDMs: an unchanging niche. This will improve confidence in SDM-based predictions of the impacts of climate change and species invasions on species distributions and biodiversity.*These authors contributed equally. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Before such causes can be analysed we need simple mathematical models which can describe the observed response patterns. For this purpose a hierarchical set of models is presented. These models are applicable to positive data with an upper bound, like relative frequencies and percentages. The models are fitted to the observations by means of logistic and non-linear regression techniques. Working with models of increasing complexity allows us to choose for the simplest possible model which sufficiently explains the observed pattern. The models are particularly suited for description of responses in time or over major environmental gradients. Deviations from these temporal or spatial trends may be statistically ascribed to, for example, climatic fluctuations or small-scale spatial heterogeneity. The applicability of this approach is illustrated by examples from recent research. A combination of simple, descriptive models like those presented in this paper and causal models as developed by several others, is advocated as a powerful tool towards a fuller understanding of the dynamics and patterns of vegetational change.},

   abstract = {Niche conservatism (NC) describes the scenario in which species retain similar characteristics or traits over time and space, and thus has potentially important implications for understanding their biogeographic distributions. Evidence consistent with NC includes similar niche properties across geographically distant regions. We investigated whether NC was evident in stream diatom morphospecies by modeling species responses to environmental and climatic variables in a set of calibration sites (from the US) and then evaluated the models with test sets (from France, Finland, New Zealand, Antilles and La Réunion). We also examined whether diatom species showed congruency in environmental niche optima and niche breadths between the study regions, and whether species occupancy and functional traits influenced the observed patterns. We used boosted regression tree models with local environmental variables and climatic variables as predictors. We detected low NC in both environmental and climate models and a lack of consistent differences in NC between widely distributed and regionally rare species and among functional groups. For all species, diatom environmental and climatic optima varied clearly between the regions but showed some positive relationships especially for pH and total phosphorus. Diatom niche breadths were only weakly correlated between the US and the other regions. We demonstrated that diatoms showed overall relatively little NC globally, and NC was especially low for climatic variables. Collectively, these findings suggest that there may exist locally adapted lineages within the diatom morphospecies or diatoms possess some adaptation potential for differences in temperature. We argue that in diatoms, environmental and especially climate models may not be transferrable in space globally but need regional diatom data for calibration because species niches seem to differ among geographical regions.},

Here, we propose the within outlying mean indexes (WitOMI), which refine the outlying mean index (OMI) analysis by using its properties in combination with the K-select analysis species marginality decomposition. The purpose is to decompose the ecological niche into subniches associated with the experimental design, i.e., taking into account temporal and/or spatial subsets. WitOMI emphasize the habitat conditions that contribute (1) to the definition of species' niches using all available conditions and, at the same time, (2) to the delineation of species' subniches according to given subsets of dates or sites. The latter aspect allows addressing niche dynamics by highlighting the influence of atypical habitat conditions on species at a given time and/or space. Then, (3) the biological constraint exerted on the species subniche becomes observable within Euclidean space as the difference between the existing fundamental subniche and the realized subniche. We illustrate the decomposition of published OMI analyses, using spatial and temporal examples. The species assemblage's subniches are comparable to the same environmental gradient, producing a more accurate and precise description of the assemblage niche distribution under environmental change.

The main difference with previously published indices is the use of a simple formula that produces a continuous Biotic Coefficient (BC) - which makes it more suitable for statistical analysis, in opposition with previous discreet biotic indices - not affected by subjectivity. Relationships between this coefficient and a complementary BI with several environmental variables are discussed. Finally, a validation of the proposed index is made with data from systems affected by recent human disturbances, showing that different anthropogenic changes in the environment can be detected through the use of this BI.

Nowadays, the main human pressure affecting diatom community in the Ebro Estuary is the hydrological alteration resulting from flow regulation and abstraction. Several limitations were encountered in the application of diatom indices (e.g. inverse response with nutrients; ecologically important species not considered).

We show that 1) Ebro delta bays harbour high-diversity diatom communities [LM identified 249 taxa] and 2) DNA metabarcoding effectively reflects this diversity at genus- but not species level, because of the incompleteness of the DNA reference library. Nevertheless, DNA metabarcoding offers new opportunities for detecting small, delicate and rare diatom species missed by LM and diatoms that lack silica frustules. The primers used, though designed for diatoms, successfully amplified rarely reported members of other stramenopile groups. Combining LM and DNA approaches offers stronger support for ecological studies of benthic microalgal communities in shallow coastal environments than using either approach on its own.},

   abstract = {Recent years provided intense progression in the implementation of molecular techniques in a wide variety of research fields in ecology. Biomonitoring and bioassessment can greatly benefit from DNA metabarcoding and High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) methods that potentially provide reliable, high quantity and quality standardized data in a cost- and time-efficient way. However, DNA metabarcoding has its drawbacks, introducing biases at all the steps of the process, particularly during bioinformatics treatments used to prepare HTS data for ecological analyses. The high diversity of bioinformatics methods (e.g., OTU clustering, chimera detection, taxonomic assignment) and parameters (e.g., percentage similarity threshold used to define OTUs) make inter-studies comparison difficult, limiting the development of standardized and easy-accessible bioassessment procedures for routine freshwater monitoring. In order to study and overcome these drawbacks, we constructed four de novo indices to assess river ecological status based on the same biological samples of diatoms analyzed with morphological and molecular methods. The biological inventories produced are (i) morphospecies identified by microscopy, (ii) OTUs provided via metabarcoding and hierarchical clustering of sequences using a 95% similarity threshold, (iii) individual sequence units (ISUs) via metabarcoding and only minimal bioinformatical quality filtering, and (iv) exact sequence variants (ESVs) using DADA2 denoising algorithm. The indices based on molecular data operated directly with ecological values estimated for OTUs/ ISUs/ ESVs. Our study used an approach of bypassing taxonomic assignment, so bias related to unclassified sequences missing from reference libraries could be handled and no information on ecology of sequences is lost. Additionally, we showed that the indices based on ISUs and ESVs were equivalent, outperforming the OTU-based one in terms of predictive power and accuracy by revealing the hidden ecological information of sequences that are otherwise clustered in the same OTU (intra-species/intra-population variability). Furthermore, ISUs, ESVs, and morphospecies indices provided similar estimation of site ecological status, validating that ISUs with limited bioinformatics treatments may be used for DNA freshwater monitoring. Our study is a proof of concept where taxonomy- and clustering-free approach is presented, that we believe is a step forward a standardized and comparable DNA bioassessment, complementary to morphological methods.},

   abstract = {<p>Diverse freshwater biological communities are threatened by invasive aquatic alien plant (IAAP) invasions and consequently, cost countries millions to manage. The effective management of these IAAP invasions necessitates their frequent and reliable monitoring across a broad extent and over a long-term. Here, we introduce and apply a monitoring approach that meet these criteria and is based on a three-stage hierarchical classification to firstly detect water, then aquatic vegetation and finally water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes, previously Eichhornia crassipes), the most damaging IAAP species within many regions of the world. Our approach circumvents many challenges that restricted previous satellite-based water hyacinth monitoring attempts to smaller study areas. The method is executable on Google Earth Engine (GEE) extemporaneously and utilizes free, medium resolution (10–30 m) multispectral Earth Observation (EO) data from either Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2. The automated workflow employs a novel simple thresholding approach to obtain reliable boundaries for open-water, which are then used to limit the area for aquatic vegetation detection. Subsequently, a random forest modelling approach is used to discriminate water hyacinth from other detected aquatic vegetation using the eight most important variables. This study represents the first national scale EO-derived water hyacinth distribution map. Based on our model, it is estimated that this pervasive IAAP covered 417.74 km2 across South Africa in 2013. Additionally, we show encouraging results for utilizing the automatically derived aquatic vegetation masks to fit and evaluate a convolutional neural network-based semantic segmentation model, removing the need for detection of surface water extents that may not always be available at the required spatio-temporal resolution or accuracy. The water hyacinth species discrimination has a 0.80, or greater, overall accuracy (0.93), F1-score (0.87) and Matthews correlation coefficient (0.80) based on 98 widely distributed field sites across South Africa. The results suggest that the introduced workflow is suitable for monitoring changes in the extent of open water, aquatic vegetation, and water hyacinth for individual waterbodies or across national extents.

   abstract = {<p>Invasive floating aquatic vegetation negatively impacts wetland ecosystems and mapping this vegetation through space and time can aid in designing and assessing effective control strategies. Current remote sensing methods for mapping floating aquatic vegetation at the genus level relies on airborne imaging spectroscopy, resulting in temporal gaps because routine hyperspectral satellite coverage is not yet available. Here we achieved genus level and species level discrimination between two invasive aquatic vegetation species using Sentinel 2 multispectral satellite data and machine-learning classifiers in summer and fall. The species of concern were water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and water primrose (Ludwigia spp.). Our classifiers also identified submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation at the community level. Random forest models using Sentinel-2 data achieved an average overall accuracy of 90%, and class accuracies of 79–91% and 85–95% for water hyacinth and water primrose, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has mapped water primrose to the genus level using satellite remote sensing. Sentinel-2 derived maps compared well to those derived from airborne imaging spectroscopy and we also identified misclassifications that can be attributed to the coarser Sentinel-2 spectral and spatial resolutions. Our results demonstrate that the intra-annual temporal gaps between airborne imaging spectroscopy observations can be supplemented with Sentinel-2 satellite data and thus, rapidly growing/expanding vegetation can be tracked in real time. Such improvements have potential management benefits by improving the understanding of the phenology, spread, competitive advantages, and vulnerabilities of these aquatic plants.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) is one of the worst plant invaders in the coastal wetlands of China. Accurate and repeatable mapping of S. alterniflora invasion is essential to develop cost-effective management strategies for conserving native biodiversity. Traditional remote-sensing-based mapping methods require a lot of fieldwork for sample collection. Moreover, our ability to detect this invasive species is still limited because of poor spectral separability between S. alterniflora and its co-dominant native plants. Therefore, we proposed a novel scheme that uses an ensemble one-class classifier (EOCC) in combination with phenological Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series analysis (TSA) to detect S. alterniflora. We evaluated the performance of the EOCC algorithm in two scenarios, i.e., single-scene analysis (SSA) and NDVI-TSA in the core zones of Yancheng National Natural Reserve (YNNR). Meanwhile, a fully supervised classifier support vector machine (SVM) was tested in the two scenarios for comparison. With these scenarios, the crucial phenological stages and the advantage of phenological NDVI-TSA in S. alterniflora recognition were also investigated. Results indicated the EOCC using only positive training data performed similarly well with the SVM trained on complete training data in the YNNR. Moreover, the EOCC algorithm presented a more robust transferability with notably higher classification accuracy than the SVM when being transferred to a second site, without a second training. Furthermore, when combined with the phenological NDVI-TSA, the EOCC algorithm presented more balanced sensitivity–specificity result, showing slightly better transferability than it performed in the best phenological stage (i.e., senescence stage of November). The achieved results (overall accuracy (OA), Kappa, and true skill statistic (TSS) were 92.92%, 0.843, and 0.834 for the YNNR, and OA, Kappa, and TSS were 90.94%, 0.815, and 0.825 for transferability to the non-training site) suggest that our detection scheme has a high potential for the mapping of S. alterniflora across different areas, and the EOCC algorithm can be a viable alternative to traditional supervised classification method for invasive plant detection.</p>},

We reconstructed plant cover for 1990–2020 using Landsat time series and modeled future potential expansion using cellular automata (CA) modeling. The overall accuracy of the results varied in the range 85–95% and the simulated plant growth using CA varied between 74% and 84%, for A. saligna and H. subaxillaris, respectively. The surface area covered by H. subaxillaris in 2020, 45 years since its introduction, was approximately 81 km2. Acacia saligna covered an area of 74.6 km2, while the vacant area available for potential spread of these two species was 630 km2. Heterotheca subaxillaris showed a mean expansion rate of 107% per decade from 2000 to 2020, while the mean expansion rate of A. saligna was lower, ranging between 48% and 54% within the same time period. Furthermore, based on the plant expansion model simulation we estimated that A. saligna and H. subaxillaris will continue to spread by 60% per decade, on average, from 2020 to 2070, with a maximum growth rate of 80% per decade during 2040–2050.

Using Alien Species Narratives as reference, we will design future intervention scenarios focused on prevention, control and eradication of IAS in Europe and the United States, through a participatory process bringing together the expertise of scientists and stakeholders. We will also adapt current impact assessment protocols to assess both the detrimental and beneficial impacts of IAS on biodiversity and ecosystem services. This information will then be combined with maps of the potential distribution of Invasive Species of Interest in Europe under current and future climate-change scenarios. Likewise, we will anticipate areas under risk of invasion by range-shifting plants of concern in the US. Finally, focusing on three local-scale studies that cover a range of habitats (freshwater, terrestrial and marine), invasive species (plants and animals) and ecosystem services (supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural), we will use empirical field data to quantify the real-world impacts of IAS on biodiversity and ecosystem services and calculate indicators of ecosystem recovery after the invader is removed. Spatial planning tools (InVEST) will be used to evaluate the costs and benefits of species-specific intervention scenarios at the regional scale. Data, models and maps, developed throughout the project, will serve to build scenarios and models of biodiversity and ecosystem services that are relevant to underpin management of IAS at multiple scales.</p>},

Since the first apparition of the species in the Strait of Gibraltar in 2015, its fast dispersion along the introduced habitats constitutes a real challenge to develop monitoring strategies that ahead of its impacts. The present study uses three different approaches to address impacts on the benthic ecosystems, at the same time offers relevant data for future management actions in El Estrecho Natural Park (PNE). Information obtained by monitoring permanent sentinel stations revealed a significant loss in resident species coverage after the moment of maximum growth in 2017. Thus, despite coverage of <italic>R. okamurae</italic> did not strongly varied in the latter years, impacts generated remain high in the habitats studied. Estimations of the invasive species coverage by combining cartographic image analysis and <italic>in situ</italic> data predicted a major occupation (over 85% coverage) between 10 and 30 m, coinciding with the maximum rocky surface areas (m <sup>2</sup> ) mapped on the PNE. Furthermore, a Citizen Science research collaboration evidenced impacts on the benthic seascape through an <italic>ad hoc</italic> exploration of images that allowed a “before” and “after” comparison of the invasion process in the same geographic locations. This has made it possible to graphically demonstrate severe changes in the underwater seascape and, therefore, the general impact of this new biological invasion. The spatial colonization estimations combined with the impacts reported by both scientific [Sessile Bioindicators in Permanent Quadrats (SBPQ) sentinel stations] and civilian (Citizen Science) monitoring methodologies claim the urgent development of further studies that allow the design of monitoring strategies against <italic>R. okamurae</italic> expansion across the Mediterranean and Atlantic waters. </p>},

   abstract = {Invasive aquatic weeds negatively affect biodiversity, fluvial dynamics, water quality, and water storage and conveyance for a variety of human resource demands. In California's Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, one submersed species—Brazilian egeria—and one floating species—waterhyacinth—are actively managed to maintain navigable waterways. We monitored the spatial and temporal dynamics of these species and their communities in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta using airborne hyperspectral data and assessed the effect of herbicide treatments used to manage these species from 2003 to 2007. Each year, submersed aquatic plant species occupied about 12% of the surface area of the Delta in early summer and floating invasive plant species occupied 2 to 3%. Since 2003, the coverage of submersed aquatic plants expanded about 500 ha, whereas the coverage of waterhyacinth was reduced. Although local treatments have reduced the coverage of submersed aquatic plants, Delta-wide cover has not been significantly reduced. Locally, multiyear treatments could decrease submersed aquatic plants spread, given that no residual plants outside the treated area were present. In contrast, the spread of waterhyacinth either has been constant or has decreased over time. These results show that (1) the objectives of the Egeria densa Control Program (EDCP) have been hindered until 2007 by restrictions imposed on the timing of herbicide applications; (2) submersed aquatic plants appeared to function as ecosystem engineers by enabling spread to adjacent areas typically subject to scouring action; (3) repeated herbicide treatment of waterhyacinth has resulted in control of the spread of this species, which also appears to have facilitated the spread of waterprimrose and floating pennywort. These results suggest that management of the Delta aquatic macrophytes may benefit by an ecosystem-level implementation of an Integrated Delta Vegetation Management and Monitoring Program, rather than targeting only two problematic species.},

In aquatic systems such as the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in California, USA, management agencies use manned aerial vehicles (MAV) imaging spectroscopy missions to map and track annual changes in invasive aquatic plants. Advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and sensor miniaturization are enabling higher spatial resolution species mapping, which is promising for early detection of invasions before they spread over larger areas. This study compared maps made from UAV-based imaging spectroscopy with the manned airborne imaging spectroscopy-derived maps that are currently produced for monitoring invasive aquatic plants in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Concurrent imagery was collected using the MAV mounted HyMap sensor and the UAV mounted Nano-Hyperspec at a wetland study site and classification maps generated using random forest models were compared. Classification accuracies were comparable between the Nano- and HyMap-derived maps, with the Nano-derived map having a slightly higher overall accuracy. Additionally, the higher resolution of the Nano imagery allowed detection of patches of water hyacinth present in the study site that the HyMap could not. However, it would not be feasible to operate the Nano as a replacement to HyMap at scale despite its improved detection capabilities due to the high costs associated with overcoming area coverage limitations. Overall, UAV-based imaging spectroscopy provides comparable or improved capability, and we suggest it could be used to supplement existing monitoring programs by focusing on target areas of high ecologic or economic priority.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Seagrasses are among the world’s most productive ecosystems due to their vast ‘blue’ carbon sequestration rates and stocks, yet have a largely untapped potential for climate change mitigation and national climate agendas like the Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement. To account for the value of seagrasses for these agendas, spatially explicit high-confidence seagrass ecosystem assessments guided by nationally aggregated data are necessary. Modern Earth Observation advances could provide a scalable technological solution to assess the national extent and blue carbon service of seagrass ecosystems. Here, we developed and applied a scalable Earth Observation framework within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to account the national extent, blue carbon stock and sequestration rate of seagrass ecosystems across the shallow waters of The Bahamas—113,037 km <sup>2</sup> . Our geospatial ecosystem extent accounting was based on big multi-temporal data analytics of over 18,000 10-m Sentinel-2 images acquired between 2017-2021, and deep feature engineering of multi-temporal spectral, color, object-based and textural metrics with Random Forests machine learning classification. The extent accounting was trained and validated using a nationwide reference data synthesis based on human-guided image annotation, recent space-borne benthic habitat maps, and field data collections. Bahamian seagrass carbon stocks and sequestration rates were quantified using region-specific <italic>in-situ</italic> seagrass blue carbon data. The mapped Bahamian seagrass extent covers an area up to 46,792 km <sup>2</sup> , translating into a carbon storage of 723 Mg C, and a sequestration rate of 123 Mt CO <sub>2</sub> annually. This equals up to 68 times the amount of CO <sub>2</sub> emitted by The Bahamas in 2018, potentially rendering the country carbon-neutral. The developed accounts fill a vast mapping blank in the global seagrass map—29% of the global seagrass extent—highlighting the necessity of including their blue carbon fluxes into national climate agendas and showcasing the need for more cost-effective conservation and restoration efforts for their meadows. We envisage that the synergy between our scalable Earth Observation technology and near-future nation-specific <italic>in-situ</italic> observations can and will support spatially-explicit seagrass and ocean ecosystem accounting, accelerating effective policy-making, blue carbon crediting, and relevant financial investments in and beyond The Bahamas. </p>},

Scientifically designed data collection ensures that estimates of relative abundance are unbiased. However, the statistical efficiency of a design-based estimator may be low under certain circumstances. We apply a recently developed spatiotemporal model that incorporates habitat variables to estimate a model-based abundance index for northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) in the Gulf of Maine. We contrast this spatiotemporal index with a classical design-based index and evaluate the impacts of differences between the two abundance indices on the stock assessment. We show that using the spatiotemporal index in the assessment model greatly alters the estimates of recruitment and spawning stock biomass and the determination of stock status. Also, incorporating the spatiotemporal index leads to less retrospective bias and outperforms the model with design-based index in terms of predictive performance through a retrospective cross-validation test. Our results suggest that temporal variability of population abundance could be exaggerated by the design-based estimator, and such imprecision may greatly affect the performance of a stock assessment and subsequent development of management decisions.</p>},

   abstract = {In the frame of the Copernicus programme, ESA has developed and launched the Sentinel-2 optical imaging mission that delivers optical data products designed to feed downstream services mainly related to land monitoring, emergency management and security. The Sentinel-2 mission is the constellation of two polar orbiting satellites Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, each one equipped with an optical imaging sensor MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument). Sentinel-2A was launched on June 23rd, 2015 and Sentinel-2B followed on March 7th, 2017. With the beginning of the operational phase the constellation of both satellites enable image acquisition over the same area every 5 days or less. To use unique potential of the Sentinel-2 data for land applications and ensure the highest quality of scientific exploitation, accurate correction of satellite images for atmospheric effects is required. Therefore the atmospheric correction processor Sen2Cor was developed by Telespazio VEGA Deutschland GmbH on behalf of ESA. Sen2Cor is a Level-2A processor which main purpose is to correct single-date Sentinel-2 Level-1C Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) products from the effects of the atmosphere in order to deliver a Level-2A Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance product. Additional outputs are an Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) map, a Water Vapour (WV) map and a Scene Classification (SCL) map with Quality Indicators for cloud and snow probabilities. Telespazio France and DLR have teamed up in order to provide the calibration and validation of the Sen2Cor processor. Here we provide an overview over the Sentinel-2 data, processor and products. It presents some processing examples of Sen2Cor applied to Sentinel-2 data, provides up-to-date information about the Sen2Cor release status and recent validation results at the time of the SPIE Remote Sensing 2017.},

   abstract = {The correction of the atmospheric effects on optical satellite images is essential for quantitative and multi-temporal remote sensing applications. In order to study the performance of the state-of-the-art methods in an integrated way, a voluntary and open-access benchmark Atmospheric Correction Inter-comparison eXercise (ACIX) was initiated in 2016 in the frame of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). The first exercise was extended in a second edition wherein twelve atmospheric correction (AC) processors, a substantially larger testing dataset and additional validation metrics were involved. The sites for the inter-comparison analysis were defined by investigating the full catalogue of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites for coincident measurements with satellites' overpass. Although there were more than one hundred sites for Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 acquisitions, the analysis presented in this paper concerns only the common matchups amongst all processors, reducing the number to 79 and 62 sites respectively. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Water Vapour (WV) retrievals were consequently validated based on the available AERONET observations. The processors mostly succeeded in retrieving AOD for relatively light to medium aerosol loading (AOD < 0.2) with uncertainties <0.08, while the overall uncertainty values were typically 0.23 ± 0.15. Better performances were observed for WV retrievals with >90% of the results falling within the suggested empirical specifications and with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) being mostly <0.25 g/cm2. Regarding Surface Reflectance (SR) validation two main approaches were followed. For the first one, a simulated SR reference dataset was computed over all of the test sites by using the 6SV (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum vector code) full radiative transfer modelling (RTM) and AERONET measurements for the required aerosol variables and water vapour content. The performance assessment demonstrated that the retrievals were not biased for most of the bands. The uncertainties ranged from approximately 0.003 to 0.01 (excluding B01) for the best performing processors in both sensors' analyses. For the second one, measurements from the radiometric calibration network RadCalNet over La Crau (France) and Gobabeb (Namibia) were involved in the validation. The performance of the processors was in general consistent across all bands for both sensors and with low standard deviations (<0.04) between on-site and estimated surface reflectance. Overall, our study provides a good insight of AC algorithms' performance to developers and users, pointing out similarities and differences for AOD, WV and SR retrievals. Such validation though still lacks of ground-based measurements of known uncertainty to better assess and characterize the uncertainties in SR retrievals.},

The camera provides images at a resolution of 5 m, with a field of view of 27 km, and the orbit of the satellite was chosen to allow us to revisit of each observed site with constant angles every second day. In November 2020, VENμS ended the first phase of its mission. This phase, called VM01, allowed us to provide about 150 accurate time series over selected scientific sites over almost three years. Extensive work was conducted to calibrate the camera and assess the quality of the products. Not everything worked as planned before launch and a large amount of work was necessary to correct some defects of the camera or to improve the geometric registration of images. This article establishes the image quality VM01 final assessment including the presentation of radiometric and geometric calibration methods, the estimation of instrument performances and their associated temporal stabilities and the monitoring activities.

The ecological effects of introduced seaweeds have been studied in only 6% of the species, but these studies show mostly negative effects or changes to the native biota. Herbivores generally prefer native to introduced seaweeds, and are unlikely to control spread, as they can do in other habitats. Undisturbed marine communities can be at least initially resistant to most introduced seaweeds aside from the siphonous green species; however, disturbances and eutrophication can facilitate invasion.

Meadows of this endemic seagrass species represent the largest carbon storage among seagrasses around the world, largely contributing to global blue carbon stocks. Yet, the slow growth of this temperate species and the extreme projected temperature and sea-level rise due to climate change increase the risk of reduction and loss of these services. Currently, there are knowledge gaps in its basin-wide spatially explicit extent and relevant accounting, therefore accurate and efficient mapping of its distribution and trajectories of change is needed. Here, we leveraged contemporary advances in Earth Observation—cloud computing, open satellite data, and machine learning—with field observations through a cloud-native geoprocessing framework to account the spatially explicit ecosystem extent of <italic>P. oceanica</italic> seagrass across its full bioregional scale. Employing 279,186 Sentinel-2 satellite images between 2015 and 2019, and a human-labeled training dataset of 62,928 pixels, we mapped 19,020 km <sup>2</sup> of <italic>P. oceanica</italic> meadows up to 25 m of depth in 22 Mediterranean countries, across a total seabed area of 56,783 km <sup>2</sup> .

We include and discuss global and region-specific seagrass blue carbon stocks using our bioregional seagrass extent estimate. As reference data collections, remote sensing technology and biophysical modelling improve and coalesce, such spatial ecosystem extent accounts could further support physical and monetary accounting of seagrass condition and ecosystem services, like blue carbon and coastal biodiversity. We envisage that effective policy uptake of these holistic seagrass accounts in national climate strategies and financing could accelerate transparent natural climate solutions and coastal resilience, far beyond the physical location of seagrass beds. </p>},

However, image classification is challenging due to spectral similarity between microphytobenthos and oyster reefs. Because these elements are strongly related to local geomorphic features, including biogenic structures, a new mapping method has been developed to overcome the current obstacles. This method is based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), RGB, and multispectral (four bands: green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared) surveys that combine high spatial resolution (e.g., 5 cm pixel), geomorphic mapping, and machine learning random forest (RF) classification. A mudflat on the Atlantic coast of France (Marennes-Oléron bay) was surveyed based on this method and by using the structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetric approach to produce orthophotographs and digital surface models (DSM). Eight classes of mudflat surface based on indexes, such as NDVI and spectral bands normalised to NIR, were identified either on the whole image (i.e., standard RF classification) or after segmentation into five geomorphic units mapped from DSM (i.e., geomorphic-based RF classification). The classification accuracy was higher with the geomorphic-based RF classification (93.12%) than with the standard RF classification (73.45%), showing the added value of combining topographic and radiometric data to map soft-bottom intertidal areas and the user-friendly potential of this method in applications to other ecosystems, such as wetlands or peatlands.</p>},
