\begin{abstract}
Coastal areas host seagrass meadows, which offer crucial ecosystem
services including erosion control and carbon sequestration. However,
these areas are increasingly impacted by human activities, leading to
seagrass decline and habitat fragmentation. In situ surveys,
traditionally performed to monitor these ecosystems face limitations on
temporal and spatial coverage, particularly in intertidal zones,
prompting the use of satellite data within monitoring programs. Yet,
satellite remote sensing struggles with spatial and spectral resolution,
making it difficult to discriminate seagrass from other macrophytes in
highly heterogenous meadows. To address these challenges and reduce the
issue of mlixed pixel, drone images at a very high spatial resolution
offer a promising solution. This study focuses on using drone
acquisitions with a ten spectral bands sensor mirroring those of
Sentinel-2, for mapping intertidal macrophytes and effectively
discriminating between seagrass and green macroalgae. Nine drone flights
were conducted at two different altitudes (12m and 120m) across diverse
European habitats in France and Portugal. Low altitude flights were used
to train a Deep Learning classifier based on Neural Networks to
discrimintate among five taxonomic classes of intertidal vegetation:
Magnoliopsida (Seagrass), Chlorophyceae (Green macroalgae), Phaeophyceae
(Brown algae), Rhodophyceae (Red macroalgae) and Bacillariophyceae
(Diatoms). Drone mapping demonstrated an overall accuracy of 94\% across
all the sites and images, covering a total area of 467 000 m². The model
exhibited an accuracy of 96.4\% in identifying seagrass. This work
showed that although they share the same pigmentary composition,
seagrass and green algae can be discriminated using ten bands
multispectral sensor. The algorithm should now be adapted for Sentinel-2
to see if this discrimination is still operational at a coarser spatial
resolution.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Coastal areas are vital hotspots for marine biodiversity, with
intertidal seagrass meadows playing a crucial role at the interface
between land and ocean \citep{unsworth2022}. Seagrass meadows provide a
myriad of ecosystem services to humanity, including carbon
sequestration, oxygen production, protection against sea-level rise and
coastline erosion, and limitation of eutrophication. They serve as vital
habitats for a diverse array of marine and terrestrial species,
providing living, breeding, and feeding grounds \citetext{\citealp[
]{gardner2018}; \citealp[ ]{Zoffoli2022}; \citealp{jankowska2019}}. Due
to the concentration of human activities in coastal zones, seagrass
meadows are directly exposed to and impacted by anthropogenic pressures.
Global regression and fragmentation are currently observed due to
climate change, diseases, urbanization, land reclamation, dredging,
competition with alien species, and reduction in water quality
\citetext{\citealp[ ]{nguyen2021}; \citealp[ ]{soissons2018}; \citealp[
]{orth2006}; \citealp[ ]{lin2018}; \citealp{duffy2019}}. While
improvements in water quality have been recently reported in Europe,
allowing an overall recovery of seagrass ecosystems at local scale, many
coastal waters worldwide are still subjected to strong eutrophication
processes \citetext{\citealp[ ]{deSantos2019}; \citealp{Zoffoli2021}}.
Coastal eutrophication has been ass ociated to anomalous accumulation of
green macroalgae, the so-called green tides
(\citep{devlin2023nutrients}). Green tides produce shade and suffocation
over seagrass individuals, thus threatening the health of seagrass
ecosystems \citep{wang2022}.

The importance of seagrass meadows and the variety of ecosystem services
they provide have led to the enhancement of both global and regional
programs monitoring Essential Oceanic Variable (EOVs) such as seagrass
composition \citep{Miloslavich2018}, as well as Essential Biodiversity
Variable (EBVs) such as seagrass taxonomic diversity, species
distribution, population abundance, and phenology \citep{Pereira2013}.
Seagrass monitoring is all the more important as it makes possible to
identify which pressure should be addressed in priority to facilitate
effective mitigation actions. Traditionally, indicators of seagrass
status have been quantified using \emph{in situ} measurements. The
acquisition of field data in intertidal zones is however notoriously
challenging. Intertidal seagrass meadows are only partially exposed
during low tide and can be situated in difficult-to-reach mudflats,
potentially leading to inaccurate and limited estimations with
conventional sampling techniques \citep{nijland2019}. Satellite
observations have been proven effective in complementing in situ
sampling, allowing for the near real-time and consistent retrieval of
seagrass EOVs and EBVs over extensive meadows. \citetext{\citealp[
]{Zoffoli2021}; \citealp[ ]{xu2021}; \citealp[
]{Traganos2018}; \citealp{coffer2023}}

While satellite remote sensing provides temporally consistent
observations over large spatial scales, it is limited by several
constraints. Satellite missions with a high temporal resolution
(e.g.~daily MODIS observation) are limited by a coarse spatial
resolution (\textgreater100m). Mission with a high spatial resolution
such as Sentinel-2 (10m) or Landsat8/9 (30m) can be limited by low
spectral resolution. The limited number of spectral bands is indeed a
challenge to accurately discriminate seagrass from others co-existing
macrophytes. In particular Chlorophyceae (green algae) and marine
Magnoliopsida (seagrass) share the same pigment composition
\citetext{\citealp[ ]{ralph2002}; \citealp{Douay2022}}. As a result,
their respective spectral signatures can be considered similar by a
non-expert observer \citetext{\citealp[
]{Davies2023}; \citealp{bannari2022}}. Recently, using advanced
machine-learning algorithms trained with a large hyperspectral library
of more then 300 field reflectance spectra, \citep{Davies2023}
demonstrated that it was possible to discriminate Magnoliopsida from
Chlorophyceae using radiometric data acquired at Sentinel-2 's spectral
resolution. The application of this approach to satellite remote sensing
remains however to be validated. Moreover patches of green algae can
develop at small spatial scales that are not observable using
non-commercial satellite imagery \citep{tuya2013}, especially during the
initial stage of the event.

Drones can potentially fill the gaps left by satellite remote sensing
and in situ measurements, due to their ability to provide
spatially-explicit observations at very high spatial resolutions (pixel
size from cm to mm) and still capturing data at multi-spectral
resolution \citetext{\citealp[
]{fairley2022drone}; \citealp{oh2017use}}. The versatility of drones
allows for their application across a diverse thematic range , from
coastal zone management \citetext{\citealp[ ]{adade2021}; \citealp[
]{casella2020}; \citealp{angnuureng2022}} to mapping species
distribution \citetext{\citealp[ ]{joyce2023}; \citealp[
]{tallam2023}; \citealp[ ]{Roca2022}; \citealp[
]{Roman2021}; \citealp{Brunier2022Topographic}}. However, when applied
to coastal habitat mapping, most study cases were limited to a single
flight, restricting the generalizability of their application over wider
geographical scales \citetext{\citealp[ ]{Roman2021}; \citealp[
]{collin2019improving}; \citealp[
]{rossiter2020uav}; \citealp{Brunier2022Topographic}}. The present study
aimed at analyzing the potential of multispectral drone remote sensing
to map intertidal macrophytes, with a particular focus on discriminating
Magnoliopsida and Chlorophyceae. Ten drone flights were performed over
soft-bottom intertidal areas along two European countries (France and
Portugal), covering a wide range of habitats, from monospecific seagrass
meadows to meadows mixed with green, or red macroalgae. A deep learning
algorithm was trained and validated for macrophyte discrimination,
emphasizing applicability across diverse sites without a loss of
prediction accuracy.

\section{Material \& Methods}\label{material-methods}

\subsection{Study sites}\label{study-sites}

Seven study sites distributed between France and Portugal were selected
for their relatively extensive intertidal seagrass beds. Two sites are
located in Gulf of Morbihan (Figure~\ref{fig-map} A), France (47.5791°N,
2.8018°W). This gulf covers an area of 115 km² and is only connected to
the sea through a 900m wide channel. A total of 53 small islands are
scattered across the gulf leading to 250 km of shorelines. Patchy
seagrass meadows can be found on a lot of these islands. Within the Gulf
of Morbihan we have chosen two sites : one is located in one of these
island (Arz island); the other one is located in the southern part of
the gulf (Duer). Two others sites are located in Bourgneuf Bay, France
(46.9849°N, 2.1488°W). This bay is 340 km² semi-enclosed macrotidal bay,
protected from waves by Noirmoutier Island. Bougneuf bay hosts a large
intertidal seagrass meadow of about 6 km². Within this meadow, the sites
observed by drones (L'Epine and Barbatre, Figure~\ref{fig-map} B)
contain a monospecific bed of \emph{Zostera noltei} with very little
mixing with other macrophytes. Three sites have been surveyed in the Ria
de Aveiro Lagoon in Portugal (40.6887°N, 8.6810°W). The extent of this
lagoon is about 80 km² with many narrow channels, large salt marshes and
many mudflats that uncovers at low tide. It is connected to the open sea
through a single channel, with a tidal lag between the North and the
South of the lagoon. The southernmost site (Gafanha) is a mudflat
located in an affluent of the lagoon whereas the two other sites are
situated in the middle of the lagoon and are only accessible by boat
(Figure~\ref{fig-map} C). These Portuguese sites are characterized by a
more diverse intertidal vegetation, where patches of seagrass could
intermingle with red, brown and green macroalgae.

\subsection{Drone Data}\label{drone-data}

At each location, a DJI Matrice 200 quadcopter drone equipped with a
Micasense RedEdge Dual MX multispectral camera was flown to take 1.2
million pixel reflectance photographs in ten spectral bands, from 444 nm
(blue) to 840 nm (near infrared, NIR). An angle of 90° was maintained
between the sun and the drone's route to guarantee uniform lighting
conditions between flight lines. A side overlap of 70\% and a front
overlap of 80\% between each image was set for each flight. A
downwelling light sensor (DLS2) was used to acquire irradiance data
concomitantly with the camera measurements. Raw data were calibrated in
reflectance using a calibration panel reflective at \textasciitilde50\%
provided by the manufacturer. A structure-from-motion photogrammetry
software (Agisoft Metashape) was used to process images to obtain
multispectral orthomosaics of each flight. The workflow for
orthomosaicking was the same for every flight. First, tying key points
were detected inside of each image and between overlapping images in
order to obtain a sparse point cloud. This cloud was cleaned using
reprojection accuracy metric in order to remove noisy points. A dense
point cloud was then produced using a structure from motion algorithm. A
surface interpolation of this dense point cloud was made to obtain a
digital surface model (DSM), used to reconstruct the multispectral
ortho-image. Across all sites, flights were made at two different
altitudes : 12 m or/and 120 m. Low altitude drone flights produce
ortho-images with a very high spatial resolution (8 mm per pixel),
making it efficient to visually distinguish between the various types of
vegetation. High altitude fights on the other hand allow to cover large
areas and produced images with a pixel size of 80 mm
(Table~\ref{tbl-flights}).

\begin{table}

a spatial resolution of 8 and 80 mm respectively.}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=6.63in,height=\textheight]{Figures/table_flights.png}

}

\end{table}%

\subsection{Field sampling}\label{field-sampling}

Before each flight, targets used as Ground Control Points (GCPs) were
distributed over the study site and georeferenced with a Trimble © Geo
XH 6000 differential GPS (dGPS). GCPs were used to correct
georeferencing imprecision of orthomosaics with an horizontal and
vertical accuracy of 10cm. dGPS was also used to georeference quadrats
of 0.25 m² assessing the presence or absence of five key taxonomic
classes of intertidal vegetation : Bacillariophyceae (Unicellular
benthic diatoms forming large biofilms at the sediment surface during
low tide), Phaeophyceae (brown macroalgae), Magnoliopsida (seagrass),
Chlorophyceae (green macroalgae) and Rhodophyceae (red macroalgae)
(Figure~\ref{fig-vegetation}). Pictures of each quadrat were uploaded
online on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) platform
\citep{BedeGbif}, a public open portal to store and share biodiversity
data. Each photograph was also processed to estimate the percent cover
of each type of vegetation using an image processing software (imageJ).
For all quadrats, the hyperspectral reflectance signatures of each
vegetation class was measured using an ASD FieldSpec HandHeld 2
spectroradiometer, which acquires reflectance between 325 and 1075 nm,
with 1 nm of spectral resolution. Hyperspectral signatures from quadrats
serve dual purposes: they validate the radiometric calibration of drone
data and contribute to error reduction in photo interpretation. The
workflow developped in this study is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-workflow}.

Diamonds represent input or output data, and rectangles represent Python
processing algorithms. The overall workflow of this study is divided
into two distinct parts based on the spatial resolution of the drone
flights: high-resolution flights (pixel size: 8 mm) were utilized for
training and prediction of the Neural Network model, whereas
lower-resolution flights (pixel size: 80 mm) were solely employed for
prediction purposes. Validation has been performed on both high and low
resolution flights.}

\end{figure}%

The spectral similarities of the reflectance signatures between
intertidal green macrophytes (Magnoliopsida and Chlorophyceae) make
their discrimination challenging using simple classification algorithms
(Figure~\ref{fig-vegetation} F). To overcome this challenge, a deep
learning classification method was developed, trained, validated, and
applied to each drone flight (Figure~\ref{fig-workflow}).

\subsubsection{Neural Network model
building}\label{neural-network-model-building}

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-validationPX}Vegetation Classes of the model and the
number of pixels used to train and validate each class}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=6.63in,height=\textheight]{Figures/table_validation_px.png}

}

\end{table}%

A dataset containing photo-interpreted drone reflectance pixels was
built to train a Neural Network model with 2 hidden layers. The training
pixels were categorized into seven different classes, representing the
various habitats encountered at the different study sites: Sediment,
Water, Chlorophyceae, Magnoliopsida, Bacillariophyceae, Phaeophyceae and
Rhodophyceae. Only low-altitude flights (Table~\ref{tbl-flights}) were
used for training because their 8 mm spatial resolution allowied to
avoid spectral sub-pixel mixing and to accurately differentiate
vegetation classes. More than 418,000 pixels at 8 mm resolution from the
3 training flights were used to train the model
(Table~\ref{tbl-validationPX}). Twenty one variables were used by the
model as predictors: the ten raw spectral bands of the Micasense RedEdge
Dual MX multispectral camera (ranging from 444 nm to 840 nm), the same
ten spectral bands standardized using a min/max transformation
(Equation~\ref{eq-std} ; \citep{Cao2017}) and the Normalized difference
vegetation index (NDVI, Equation~\ref{eq-ndvi}). Standardisation of
spectral bands is used to eliminate the scaling differences between
spectra and to limit the effect of biomass on the shape of the spectra
\citetext{\citealp[ ]{Douay2022}; \citealp{Davies2023}}.

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-std}{
R_{i}^{*}(\lambda) = \frac{R_{i}(\lambda) - min(R_{i})}{max(R_{i})- min(R_{i})}
}\end{equation}

where \(R_{i}(\lambda)\) is the reflectance at the wavelength
\((\lambda)\) of each individual spectra \((i)\), \(min(R_{i})\), and
\(max(R_{i})\) are the minimum and maximum value of the spectra \((i)\)

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-ndvi}{
NDVI = \frac{R(840nm)-R(668nm)}{R(840nm)+R(668nm)}
}\end{equation}

where \(R(840nm)\) is the reflectance at 840 nm and \(R(668nm)\) is the
reflectance at 668 nm.

\subsubsection{Validation}\label{validation}

The workflow of this study revolves around two distinct flight heights
(12 m and 120 m, Figure~\ref{fig-workflow}) where ensuring consistency
between reflectances at both heights is crucial. This comparison was
conducted at sites where low and high altitude flights overlapped. The
low altitude flights were resampled to the same spatial resolution and
grid as the high flights using a median resampling method. Reflectance
values were then extracted, and a scatterplot was generated.
Subsequently, the slope of the linear model and the coefficient of
determination (R²) were computed.

The model was applied to all flights at both 12 and 120 m of altitude.
In situ information on georeferenced class type and percent cover
collected during each flight was used to assess the model accuracy.
These images were used to construct a validation dataset indicating the
presence or absence of each class. Additionally to the quadrat-based
validation dataset, polygons of each class were photo interpreted in
order to increase the number of pixels of the validation dataset. A
confusion matrix, along with precision metrics such as global accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa coefficient, was generated for each
sites. All validation matrices were then merged to create a unique
matrix . Altogether, a total of 536,000 pixels was used to validate the
model, thus providing a geographically robust validation dataset.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Classification}\label{classification}

A total of nine prediction maps corresponding to the nine drone flights
were obtained. Each prediction map is associated with a probability map,
indicating the probability of the selected class for every pixel. The
low-altitude flight conducted in Gafanha, Portugal, represents the site
with the highest complexity (Figure~\ref{fig-GafLow}). Among the five
vegetation classes on which the model was trained, four were present on
this site, with Chlorophyceae and Rhodophyceae mixed with the seagrass
meadow. There was also Bacillariophyceae forming biofilms on parts of
sediment surface. Although the seagrass bed was solely composed of
\emph{Zostera noltei}, various colors of this could be observed from
dark green (corresponding to healthy leaves) to whitish/brown (when
leaves were discolored having lost their pigmentation). Regardless of
color, the meadow was predicted as Magnoliopsida by the model.

\end{figure}%

The high-altitude flight over Gafanha covered nearly 1 km² in total
(Figure~\ref{fig-GafHigh}). A channel delineating a small island was
masked in the prediction map due to sunglint and misclassification
caused by the turbid shallow water. Most of the intertidal area was
classified as Magnoliopsida by the model, including seagrass patches
with discolored leaves. Only a few pixels were classified as
Chlorophyceae at this scale. Furthermore, the area that was classified
as Bacillariophyceae in the low-altitude flight remained mostly
classified as such in the high-altitude flight, though some pixels were
classified as Magnoliopsida. Patches of Rhodophyceae were correctly
classified. In the nothern part of the scene, near the land limit,
patches of the schorre angiosperm \emph{Spartina sp.} were
misclassified, either as Magnoliopsida or as Phaeophyceae.

The high altitude flight acquired over the inner lagoon of the Ria de
Aveiro was the largest of all flights, covering almost 1.5 km²
(Figure~\ref{fig-Boat}). The site was dominated by seagrass and the red
macroalgae \emph{Gracilaria vermicullophyla}. The classification
provided consistent results, with a patchy seagrass meadow mixed with
red macroalgae on the eastern part of the scene. As shown in the zoom
(Figure~\ref{fig-Boat}), the edges of the meadow were colonised by green
macroalgae

The flight over L'Epine in Noirmoutier Island, France
(Figure~\ref{fig-Dike}) was conducted near a dike crossing the northern
part of the scene from west to east. Alongside this dike, brown algae
for the order Fucales (\emph{Fucus spp.}, \emph{Ascophyllum nodosum})
were attached to sparse rocks and stranded green algae (\emph{ulva
spp.}) could be observed Despite the high mixture between Chlorophyceae
and Magnoliopsida these two classes were correctly discriminated by the
classifier.

\end{figure}%

A total of 536,000 pixels was used to validate the Neural Network
classifier. The sites with the lowest and highest number of validation
data were Kerdrean (5557 pixels) and Marinha Lanzarote (159713 pixels),
respectively. Model global accuracy was 94.26\% with a Kappa coefficient
of 0.92 (Figure~\ref{fig-Validation}). The least performing site was
Gafanha High (global accuracy of 75.45\%) whereas Mataducos was the site
with the most accurate prediction (global accuracy of 98.05\%). Overall,
the classes Phaeophyceae, Magnoliopsida, Sediment and Rhodophyceae were
correctly classified with a balanced accuracy of 1, 0.96, 0.96 and 0.91
respectively. Bacillariophyceae was the least performing class (accuracy
of 0.72 ) mainly due to the confusion with Magnoliopsida and Sediment.

\subsection{Variable importance}\label{variable-importance}

important is the variable to predict accurately this class. The right

class. Each slice represent the VIP of both raw and standardised
reflectance combined.}

\end{figure}%

The computation of the variable importance made it possible to identify
which wavelengths were the most useful for class prediction
(Figure~\ref{fig-VIP}). The spectral bands at 444, 717 and 842 nm of the
Micasense camera did not came out as important for any of the vegetation
classes. The band at 531 nm was the only important predictor for the
classifier to accurately predict Chlorophyceae. In fact, at this
wavelength, the Chlorophyceae spectra have the highest reflectance among
of all vegetation classes. The bands at 531 and 740 nm were the most
important predictors for Phaeophyceae, corresponding to the lowest
reflectance among all classes. Bands at 475 and 560 nm are the most
important predictors for Bacillariophyceae and Rhodophyceae,
respectively. Four predictors, ranging from the green (560 nm) to the
RedEdge (705 nm) bands were important to accurately predict
Magnoliopsida.

prediction}\label{effect-of-the-flight-height-on-the-prediction}

of classes was retrieved using the result of the classification of the
low altitude flight of Gafanha, Portugal. The vertical dashed line shows
the 0.85 probability of the model. Everything on the right of this line
has a probability higher then 0.85 and everything on the left of this
line has a lower probability.}

\end{figure}%

Using the very high resolution low altitude flight, we determined the
minimal percent cover required to classify correctly a given class using
the high altitude flight (Figure~\ref{fig-upscaling}). When the percent
cover of the class was 100 \%, coarser high-flight pixels are well
classified for all the classes except for Bare Sediment, which was well
classified 80\% of the time. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the
time gap between the two flights, allowing for microphytobenthos
migration, consequently altering the model's classification from bare
sediment to Bacillariophyceae. A percent cover of at least 80\% was
needed to have all the low resolution pixels well classified, at the
exception of Magnoliopsida that needs a higher percent cover
(\textgreater90 \%) to be well classified. Concerning the probability of
each class, the highest percent cover was needed to confidently predict
Bacillariophyceae. To predict Chlorophyceae with a confidence of 0.85, a
percent cover of 93 \% was needed, 90 \% for Magnoliopsida, 92 \% for
Rhodophyceae and 97 \% for Bacillariophyceae.

\subsection{Vegetation Discrimination}\label{vegetation-discrimination}

\end{figure}%

The primary objective of this study was to develop a method for the
accurate classification of macrophytes on intertidal mudflats,
specifically focusing on distinguishing between Chlorophyceae (green
macroalgae) and marine Magnoliopsida (seagrasses) using multispectral
drone data. The ability to differentiate between various types of
vegetation, as demonstrated in this study, plays a critical role in
ecological monitoring and management. By distinguishing between
seagrasses and macroalgae, our approach facilitates targeted
conservation strategies, enabling more effective preservation and
restoration efforts in coastal ecosystems. The discrimination of
seagrasses from green macroalgae presents significant challenges
\citetext{\citealp[ ]{oiry2021using}; \citealp{Bannari2022}}, primarily
due to the shared pigment composition between these taxa
\citep{mckenzie2020global}, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig-Pigm} but
also by the frequent spatial mixing of these green macrophytes. These
green macrophytes have in common photosynthtic pigmetns, chlorophyll a
and b, and accessory carotenoid pigments zeaxantin, lutein and
neoxanthin. As a result the spectral signatures are often
indistinguishable in the visible wavelength region. This spectral
overlap is further complicated by the intermingling of seagrasses and
green macroalgae in the same spatial locations, posing a significant
challenge for remote sensing aimed at accurately mapping and monitoring
coastal ecosystems. Our study addresses these complexities by using
high-resolution drone imagery with 10 spectral bands. \citep{Davies2023}
have shown that having at least eight spectral bands ranging between 500
nm to 850 nm including a green band at 530 nm and another one in the
RedEdge region at 730 nm was crucial to accurately discriminate green
macrophytes.

}

\caption{\label{fig-ValidationGreen}Sample of
Figure~\ref{fig-Validation} focusing on green macrophytes. The labels
inside the matrice indicate the number of pixels.}

\end{figure}%

The Micasense RedEdge-MX DUAL camera used in this study meets these two
criteria, enabling the classifier to achieve 97\% of accuracy between
these two classes (Figure~\ref{fig-ValidationGreen}). Even if the
pigment composition of green macrophytes is similar, differences in the
spectral shape can still be observed (Figure~\ref{fig-vegetation}).
Several factors can explain these differences such has different pigment
concentration and/or proportion \citep{bargain2013seasonal}, different
cellular organisation and the disposition of the plant on the sediment
surface \citetext{\citealp[ ]{beach1997vivo}; \citealp[
]{kirk1994light}; \citealp{hedley2018influence}}.

The VIP analysis of the Neural Network model (Figure~\ref{fig-VIP})
identified that the 531 nm band as the most important spectral band for
accurately identifying Chlorophyceae. In fact, at this wavelength,
Chlorophyceae exhibited the highest reflectance among all other classes,
highlighting the difference in accessories carotenoid proportion between
seagrasses and green macroalgae \citep{repolho2017seagrass}.

Concerning Phaeophyceae, the thick cell walls of these macroalgae
\citep{charrier2021growth} make it more reflective in the infrared part
of the spectra \citep{Slaton2001} whereas the presence of Fucoxanthin
and Zeaxanthin result in a low reflectance in the visible part of the
electromagnetic spectra (Figure~\ref{fig-Pigm} ; Figure~\ref{fig-VIP}).
These two key features have been identified by the Neural Network as the
two principal predictors to accurately identify brown algae
(Figure~\ref{fig-VIP}). Similarly, the presence of phycoerythrin and
phycocyanin in Rhodophyceae contributes to the lowest reflectance among
all classes in the spectral range of 560 to 615 nm
(Figure~\ref{fig-VIP}). The band at 560 nm has been identified as
important for accurately identifying this class probably in relation to
the absorption by phycoerythrin (\textbf{REF}). Regarding
Bacillariophyceae, the VIP analysis (Figure~\ref{fig-VIP}) indicated
that 475 nm was the most important predictor for this class. classes.
This is not a usual diagnostic wavelength for Bacillariophyceae which is
mainly identified by the presence of fucoxanthin and chlorophyll c
(Table 11), but it correspond to the absorption of diadinoxanthin an
accessory pigment characteristic of this class
\citep{meleder2003spectrometric}. Furethemore, it is vegetation with the
lowest concentration of chlorphyll-a, pigment absorbing light both in
the blue and the red. The transparency of Bacillariophyceae makes the
reflectance of the sediment part of the overall reflectance of
Bacillariophyceae, further explaining the high reflectance in the blue.

\subsection{Spectral Spatial Temporal Resolution impact on the
prediction}\label{spectral-spatial-temporal-resolution-impact-on-the-prediction}

\phantomsection\label{cell-fig-CompareRef}

plots standardised data.}

\end{figure}%

In this study, a key innovation lies in the utilization of two different
altitudes (12m and 120m) for constructing the neural network model. The
lower altitude flights (8mm spatial resolution) enabled precise
selection of pure pixels representing the classes used in the neural
network model. This methodology implies a consistency between the
reflectance of both altitude. Figure~\ref{fig-CompareRef} depicts the
relationship between reflectance from a low-altitude flight and a
high-altitude flight conducted over the same area. Overall there was a
good agreement between the two altitudes. There was however a slight
underestimation for raw reflectance values in the high-altitude flight,
particularly for higher values (Figure~\ref{fig-CompareRef} A). Since
both flights were conducted over vegetation areas, the highest
reflectance values correspond to the infrared part of the spectrum.

The disparity in infrared reflectance may stem from temporal differences
between the flights, possibly resulting in a slightly drier intertidal
area and consequently higher infrared reflectance. This disparity poses
an issue for the methodology followed in the present study, relying
solely on one flight height for training. To address this issue, we
employed min/max standardized reflectance spectra as predictors for the
model (Equation~\ref{eq-std} ; \citep{Cao2017}). This approach allowed
us to eliminate the slight reflectance difference between the flights
(Figure~\ref{fig-CompareRef} B) and to focus on the shape of the spectra
in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectra, where different
pigmentation are associated to taxonomic dignostic features. This was a
key feature in building a model that could reliably predict vegetation
across geographical sites and seasons. It enabled consistent prediction
of vegetation classes across variations in biomass and variability in
light conditions \citetext{\citealp[ ]{fyfe2003spatial}; \citealp[
]{COSTA2021107018}; \citealp{piaser2023impact}}.

The Figure~\ref{fig-upscaling} demonstrates that a seagrass cover
percentage of 90 \% is necessary for confident prediction of seagrass
presence. This highlights a limitation of the methodology used to
construct the training dataset for the model. The dataset was composed
exclusively of pure pixels, which has resulted in the model's reduced
confidence when faced with lower percentages of seagrass cover.
Intertidal seagrasses exhibit marked phenology, with varying pigment
composition throughout the year\citetext{\citealp[
]{bargain2013seasonal}; \citealp{legare2022remote}}. Since the training
dataset has been made using well developed seagrass meadows, outside of
the biomass peak of seagrasses, this model may be less accurate. Further
investigation is warranted to explore this aspect.

\subsection{Application of the model}\label{application-of-the-model}

Climate change, global warming, alien and invasive species development,
coastal erosion, sealevel rise, while further impact coastal ecosystems
in the future \citetext{\citealp{SCHIBALSKI2022101414}; \citealp[
]{holon2018predictive}; \citealp{marquet2024global}}. The demand for
meaningful and efficient monitoring methods for these habitats has
therefore never been greater \citetext{\citealp[
]{muller2018satellite}; \citealp[
]{villalobos2023remote}; \citealp{oiry2021using}}. Our findings,
particularly the improved discrimination of seagrass from other
intertidal vegetation taxonomic classes, underscore the potential of
drone-based remote sensing to support diverse applications, from
biodiversity conservation to climate change adaptation strategies.
Employing traditional sampling methods to monitor these ecosystems is
time and resource-intensive, and the findings are often difficult to
scale up. Earth observation methods can bridge this gap and meet the
needs for monitoring coastal ecosystems.
\citep{papathanasopoulou2019satellite}. The retrieval of Essential
Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) and Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs)
through satellite observations is increasingly common, enabling
comprehensive monitoring of entire ecosystems over extended time periods
\citetext{\citealp[
]{ratnarajah2023monitoring}; \citealp{ZOFFOLI2020112020}}. The
significance of monitoring coastal environment, particularly in light of
the Water Framework Directive (WFD ; \citep{WFD2000}), cannot be
overstated in environmental management and conservation efforts. The WFD
mandates the achievement and maintenance of ``good ecological status''
for all European waters, which necessitates a comprehensive
understanding and monitoring of aquatic ecosystems, including coastal
habitats like seagrass \citetext{\citealp[
]{foden2007angiosperms}; \citealp[
]{nordlund2024one}; \citealp{Zoffoli2021}}.

Effective and efficient monitoring tools are essential for identifying
the impacts of human activities and natural changes on these ecosystems.
Drones, with their capability for high-resolution, multispectral
imagery, flight on demand, provide a novel and powerful means to rapidly
and accurately acquire ground truth data (i.e.~output of the model used
in the present study). These data are critical for calibrating and
validating satellite remote sensing applications, thereby enhancing our
capacity to monitor vast coastal areas systematically under the WFD
framework. A perspective of this work is to adapt the algorithm for
Sentinel-2 to see of the discrimination between seagrass and green
macroalgae is still operational at a coarser spatial resolution. The
integration of drone technology facilitates a scalable approach to
environmental surveillance, offering significant advancements in the
spatial and temporal resolution of data collection. This, in turn,
supports the directive's objectives by enabling more informed and timely
management decisions for the preservation and restoration of aquatic
ecosystems.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

The utilization of very high-resolution drone-based remote sensing
coupled with machine learning techniques has proven to be an effective
method for the discrimination of seagrasses from green macroalgae with a
multispectral resolution sensor. Standardized reflectance were
incorporated in the Neural Network model allowing for a better
discrimination of spectral features related to pigment absorption in the
visible. There was a striking difference for the variable of importance
to discriminate Magnoliopsida from Chlorophyceae. The latter was
essentially identify with the 451 nm spectral band while more spetral
bands were needed to identify the former, notably 650, 560, 668, and 705
nm. As the spectral bands of the Micasense RedEdge Dual MX are very
similar to those of Sentinel-2, we suggest that multispectral satellite
data have the potential to perform this discrimination between green
macrophytes. The algorithm should now be adapted to Sentinel-2 with all
the drone data from this study that can be used as training and
validation data. The findings underscore the importance of adopting
advanced remote sensing tools in ecological studies and environmental
monitoring, providing a foundation for future research and policy
implementation aimed at ecosystem preservation and restoration.
